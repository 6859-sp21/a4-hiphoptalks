    "plain": "After hinting at it for a few days, Joe Budden finally released his diss track aimed at Drake.\n\nTheir conflict started when Joe said he wasn\u2019t impressed by Drake\u2019s April 2016 album, Views. Drake responded by throwing subliminal shots at Joe on \u201c4PM in Calabasas.\u201d\n\nJoe\u2019s response comes in the form of this 6-minute scorcher in which he dismantles Drake from top to bottom. A snippet of an earlier diss track was made public a few days prior to the release of this track and included the following lines by Budden:\n\nMy words ain\u2019t ghostwritten I ain\u2019t Drake\nThat\u2019s all gimmick I\u2019m authentic I ain\u2019t Drake\nAin\u2019t nothing wrong with it, only saying I ain\u2019t fake\n\nMaking A Murderer is also the name of a popular Netflix show that Joe is a big fan of. In this instance, Drake\u2019s comments have forced Joe to become one.\nhttps://twitter.com/JoeBudden/status/748367893767786496\n\nJoe addressed this song in the 71st episode of his I\u2019ll Name This Podcast Later, where he said that if Meek Mill (the rapper involved in another feud with Drake a year prior) were to diss him, he\u2019d return the favor.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDNTKSmutWw\n\nHollow Da Don and Budden clashed in the main event of the rap battle arena, \u201cTotal Slaughter,\u201d in July 2014. The judges awarded Hollow with the win and since, Hollow responded to Making a Murderer Part 1 with his own response.\n\nDrake\u2019s initial diss which launched Budden to fire this track was his verse on French Montana\u2019s track, \u201cNo Shopping.\u201d"

       "plain": "After hinting at it for a few days, Joe Budden finally released his diss track aimed at Drake.\n\nTheir conflict started when Joe said he wasn\u2019t impressed by Drake\u2019s April 2016 album, Views. Drake responded by throwing subliminal shots at Joe on \u201c4PM in Calabasas.\u201d\n\nJoe\u2019s response comes in the form of this 6-minute scorcher in which he dismantles Drake from top to bottom. A snippet of an earlier diss track was made public a few days prior to the release of this track and included the following lines by Budden:\n\nMy words ain\u2019t ghostwritten I ain\u2019t Drake\nThat\u2019s all gimmick I\u2019m authentic I ain\u2019t Drake\nAin\u2019t nothing wrong with it, only saying I ain\u2019t fake\n\nMaking A Murderer is also the name of a popular Netflix show that Joe is a big fan of. In this instance, Drake\u2019s comments have forced Joe to become one.\nhttps://twitter.com/JoeBudden/status/748367893767786496\n\nJoe addressed this song in the 71st episode of his I\u2019ll Name This Podcast Later, where he said that if Meek Mill (the rapper involved in another feud with Drake a year prior) were to diss him, he\u2019d return the favor.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDNTKSmutWw\n\nHollow Da Don and Budden clashed in the main event of the rap battle arena, \u201cTotal Slaughter,\u201d in July 2014. The judges awarded Hollow with the win and since, Hollow responded to Making a Murderer Part 1 with his own response.\n\nDrake\u2019s initial diss which launched Budden to fire this track was his verse on French Montana\u2019s track, \u201cNo Shopping.\u201d"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Joe Budden]\nI'm right here per your request, now you stuck in them shoes\nNo alliances with Meek, it's still fuck him too\nBefore we start, to the fans, I'm uncomfortable too\nStuck in the booth feelin' like y'all cause I got love for the dude\nBut now my phone blowin' up, they're like what I'm gonna do?\nShow the world you shouldn't poke a man with nothin' to lose\nAll of this just because I wasn't in love with his Views\nWhatever happened, I just know they got me fuckin' confused, hey\n\n[Interlude]\nMic check, mic check\nOne two, one two\nWait a minute!\nDrake: I'm happy, I'm honored... I'm, I'm, I'm honored to be around you, man\nJoe Budden: Yo c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon\nDrake: Okay so I can't be honest on your network here? I can't be honest to your fans and say I'm honored to be around you?\nJoe Budden: It ain't an honor to be around me!\nDrake: We all used to listen to you so I don't even... you need to learn how to take compliments. Don't say that in vain, he's one of the best. You know that, right?\nOther Person: What up? What up?\nDrake: I said don't say it in vain, you know he's one of the best\nOther Person: Nah it's all love\n\nNew Joe Budden!\n\n[Verse 2: Joe Budden]\nLook, enough of the sentimental crap\nCool if you into that\nFuck all of these subs, who they intended at?\nI won't believe it's me without forensic facts\nThey don't normally mention Black when pennin' their raps\nBut then I listen back, I heard a pinch of sass\nTender ass Teddy come around, he gon' get pinned to grass\nI come around with every inch of the mag\nI'm a wordsmith forreal, you thought Quentin was bad\nYou made me proud, lad, but it seems my child mad\nWith all the clout that he grabbed, it's still doubts from his dad\nLook, this ain't promotional, you just emotional\nNo doubt you got Starbucks, with all that Joe in you\nI part his reign lightnin' fast, just what Joseph do\nA black cloud all over the 6, check the overview\nYou're so indirect, shit wasn't real clear\nEither Jimmy actin' or he really miss a wheelchair\nWhat he don't know is we the most kindred of souls\nI should've did this two Kendricks ago\nHe wanna sing? Well let's get into the show, commence my role\nFor Jodeci, Boyz II Men, we at the end of the road\nI figure he's that close to his death to know the reaper\nIn fitted sweats with old sneakers, the flow ether\nGassed cause he KO'd Omeeka, no Joe's deeper\nQuick to put extension on singer, that's Moesha\nNothin' 'bout Rick slick, but show of the Caesar\nMy crust from the same old pizza as Mona Lisa\nSo how you callin' out the lyrical god?\nYour face light up when you see me, talkin' Miracle Watts\nCause your words ain't sayin' a thing\nI kilogram without weighin' a thing\nNigga you baitin' a king\nTell you the way that Golden State say to it's team\nAubrey you gotta make a shot, you wanna play on the wing\n\n[Hook: Andrea Martin]\nDem a call me a murderer\nI never duck, just spray\nI'ma never miss mi aim\nDem a call me a murder\nThere's some truth in that saying\nDem a call me a murder\nNobody seen nothing, nobody seen nothing\nWhat I see, ayy\n\n[Verse 3: Joe Budden]\nLook here, I just spit the facts, raging aristocrat\nShooters heard them words, wanna get rid of that\nWhen they roll up, bet dude won't wanna live his raps\nHe'll see the 6 upside down and wanna switch it back\nWrath of a god sinner\nI'm too real, I bet your star's tender\nI bet a mil', I'll bet a star tender\nBut since the OG's Hov, here's what I wanna know\nIf ain't no real niggas allowed the fuck would I wanna go?\nThat's thinkin' back to Jay, now let's get back to Drake\nBoth too big to respond to all I have to say\nStill with all their success and all their accolades\nThe universe makes it so they come right back to me\nHere's a reminder that we go way back\nI mean um, you know for me the kid is practice, Hova\nI make these words flip as if they practice yoga\nOkay practice over, back to Blacklist Hova\nNothin' personal, this Red Reddington\nShawn, I don't work for you, still I'm doin' the work for you\nPayback, wire his jaw, reimbursin' you\nMetal all behind his face, Sprite commercial you\nMight have made a mistake out of this one\nCan't Bell Biv Devoe your way out of this one, nah\nSo, warn your damn campaign that hammers rang\nI just bought a New Edition, you can't stand the rain\nY'all say this soft nigga hard and that, I can't explain\nY'all think he's soul for real, I see candy rain\nSo Aubrey when you sub real MCs, you get murdered\nAnd since you signed to five guys, makes you a burger\n\n[Hook: Andrea Martin]\nDem a call me a murderer\nI never duck, just spray\nI'ma never miss mi aim\nDem a call me a murder\nNobody seen nothing, nobody seen nothing\nWhat I see, ayy\n\n[Interlude: Joe Budden]\nReal quick, I don't wanna talk too long. I think you misconstrued the boundaries of this relationship and this friendship. Which in return, has caused me to do the exact same thing. I don't understand how you niggas, and how you in particular, how you can fuck shorty and I dap you and say you a real nigga, and I critique your album and all of a sudden we sensitive. I don't understand how you new niggas work. Maybe I'm out of touch with the rules of today's society. I'm clearing all that. Now let me paint who I am before I allow another nigga to do it for me\n\n[Verse 4: Joe Budden]\nI'm from the school of pussy don't get me punch drunk\nMaybe it's different in the city you come from, look\nI'm from the school of these hoes belong to everybody\nNo celeb exempt, goes for everybody\nSo when I seen you fucked shorty, not a bitter bone in me\nI ain't think of how to handle the plan\nSaid I'm aware, have fun, understand that it's, fam\nTold that to you and not her, that's just the man that I am\nMy nigga, kids got no respect\nOdd cause you called me for the hoe check on every hoe you checked\nThat makes sense, bad bitches, that's what Joe do best\nAnd I's the man 'round these parts when they ain't know you yet\nWhich kinda makes me your OG in Toronto\nAnd I ain't charge once, that's for free in Toronto\nI'm unsure how that came to be in Toronto\nNigga I don't even be in Toronto\nWhen it rains it pours\nAll that means, dog, get please get a poncho\nSubs fell short like a free throw from Rondo\nSo rude, he gay, so mean with all the Budden threats\nAs soon as we shoot at King, DeMarcus Cousins' next\nThis shit is truly a movie\nYou started a trend bein' a groupie for groupies\nShit, I had Bria in the coupe and out her way\nBefore you ever wrote an interlude about her\nSo who you playin' with, clown\nI'm first shift at the bars, so only means I already made them rounds\nThey say that he the best MC and best flow'er\nHe cook better than me but you love my leftovers\nFire the kill shot, the fire still hot\nWord to your Versace velours that Kyra still got\nYou playin' chess with the chrome of the pump\nLet it blast, checkered past, shoulda known from the jump\nIt's whatever you wanna roll, executives got your soul\nSedatives, I'm repetitive with those records, show for\nRegular Joe, sellin' records was never the goal\nI never sold records, I kept records of what was sold\nMight have made a mistake out of this one\nDay's long, can't Trey Songz your way out of this one\nSo don't worry yourself, and before I go\nFuck a record label, I appear courtesy of myself, Joe"

   "lyrics": "[Verse]\nTell me how long are we suppose to act like this?\nWe won't never get on track like this\nHow can I ever tell you how I feel if you react like this?\nYou call me over here to talk and I get attacked like this\nIt's funny\nGot your track shoes on but what you running from\nShit I know where you going and where you coming from\nThat\u2019s immaturity showing, its just the baby in you\nOne of the reasons why I never put a baby in you\nTired of hearing how you\u2019ll never trust me again\nHow you love me, then you hate me, then you love me again\nOne minute I\u2019m your soul-mate then it\u2019s fuck me again\nUntil you get horny enough and wan' fuck me again, but check it\nI just wan' treat you good and do better\nYou think I\u2019m running round tryna be the hood's Hugh Heffner\nSay I\u2019m all about hoes, when I\u2019m all about you\nEven when I\u2019m with my hoes, I tell them all about you\nSay that\u2019s just one reason I keep losing you\nI don\u2019t understand it, that shit is confusing too\nYou left me, I\u2019m doing me, you doing you\nSo what the fuck is me doing me have to do witchu?\nHow dare you tell me it's tougher for you?\nLike I don\u2019t hear about them niggas you fucking with too?\nI'd never knew you thought like that (dammit)\nWho knew you was into sports like that\nMore prayers because they all players\nYou out there having a ball, player, ball player after ball player\nI mean you with the ball players more than ball players\nHope they ain't fucking you and making you they ball-player\nCome to me, I just get a hard time\nWhy they give one to you, is this what you wan' do?\nWith me you get an attitude, you get all stuck up\nStart calling me a fuck up till I tell you shut the fuck up\nYeah, but the part I don\u2019t respect is\nYou so cool with every other one of your exes\nIt's history between us, all ain't right either\nBack and forth domestic, all ain't flights either\nBe wanting you close to me, supposedly\nYou say you over me, that just comes across as a joke to me\n'Cause you ain't got the kind of love that expires\nWorst case, you\u2019ll get tired, tell your friends I'm a liar\nTried therapy when we felt it going sour\nThat\u2019s four-hundred dollars every hour\nFor him to come and mediate, referee, be our interpreter\nTell me I need to lower my voice, don\u2019t curse at her\nSays she\u2019s only frustrated 'cause I keep hurtin' her\nTell me despite all that, he can tell that I worship her\nSoon as you let your guard down, I get it up again\nFixing it is too much work, so I give up again\nBut I wan' spend the rest of my life with you\nMake a wife with you, make it alright with you\nBut how are you ever suppose to think that I\u2019m right for you\nWhen all I ever do is treat you like a recyclable\nDisgraceful and you want me to chase you\nBut it's easier for me to replace you, 'cause I see it like\nIf you can't deal with what we go through\nI got bitches lined up, I got a ego too\nAnd to them I\u2019m everything, funny, I'm great and I\u2019m charming\nBut to you I\u2019m alarming, all I do is bring harm in\nTo you, I\u2019m the cause of all your misery\nOf course I disagree, you going off our history\nAll that arguing just ain't my style\n'Cause that anger now got us like strangers now\nYou tell me I should get help and I\u2019m sick in the head\nYou found makeup on the sheets, I had a bitch in our bed\nBut wait, I ain't love her though, I ain't fuck her though\nI could dead that bitch right now man, fuck that hoe\nYou just think I'll get another and another hoe\nWay you talk to me it's like I got a whole club of hoes\nBut I could switch gears, make 'em all disappear\nYou going through my phone like I got a bitch in there\nWe discussing chicks after they through\nThey don\u2019t matter to me, but for some reason they matter to you\nWe keep having the same threesome\nBut not the kind that come as a blessing, nah\nYou keep bringing up my last girl like she ain't my past girl\nLike you ain't the reason she present, check it\nYou ain't gotta worry about me and her\nIf I wanted to be with her I would be with her\nYeah, we hung together, strip clubs, had fun together\nBut that\u2019s done, don't sweat her, uh\nYou the only one I wanna do a bid with\nLive with, share my last name, have kids with\nCan't be understated, anytime we ever dated\nYou compare me in your head to some nigga you created\nI\u2019m a long way from perfect, I got shit with me\nStill I want you to love me unconditionally\nNine-years in, I don\u2019t deserve what you giving me\nLike you get a victory by acting like a dick to me\nWant me to see how it feels, I get the trickery\nLesson learned though, you my missing piece\nGive another chance to your ex\nYou don\u2019t pick up the phone, you don\u2019t answer my texts\nBitch, we ain't give it all that we got\nStill ain't empty the clip, let's give it one more shot\nOr we can go ahead on our own\nI need you I can\u2019t do this alone\n\n[Outro: Brandon Hall & Emanny]\nBut you keep running away\nBut you keep running away\nBut you keep running away\nBut you keep running away\nBut you keep running away\nBut you keep running away\nBut you keep running away"

   "lyrics": "[Part 1]\nMy path for tomorrow is relaxing at full throttle\nBorn to be a leader but a tough act to follow\nBet on me at all costs in spite of my cash\nSo if I can\u2019t afford the Waldorf, I can afford to fall off\nStories over greatness, no stopping my zone\nI\u2019m bumping \"Roman\u2019s Revenge,\" but I\u2019m plotting my own\nLike a prophecy in case niggas haven\u2019t learned not to bother me\n'Fore you send your shots, just check my return policy\nCould do without the leeches, shoes without the creases\nMiami Heat hater but I do the South Beaches\nFor any drama I be calling up monsters\nI ain't Gilbert I never met a Wall I can\u2019t conquer\nRuger aimed if I\u2019m who you try and belittle\nI learned it\u2019s hard to get justice when you try and be civil\nWhatever the future holds I can live with the day\nSome niggas will sell their soul but some will give it away\nAnd that\u2019s the devil in disguise they window of opportunity is minimized\nSimplified, check what I exemplify\nBitch nigga, here\u2019s something for you to generalize\nEstate out by Tenafly, pool houses, winterized\nPlay in that water, you bound to get your feet wet\nOnly rapper with nuttin' to hide, me and G-Dep\nMy shorty might disagree with that sentiment\nIf I keep something from you, I promise it\u2019s all innocent\nBitches gon get you with that fake out beat\nI won\u2019t let them Media Takeout me, a made nigga\nGotta know when dealing with me you gon' put up with a lot of hate\nBefore you say you love me, how much of it can you tolerate?\nYou can\u2019t talk about marriage and giving birth\nIf you hit the dirt anytime you think I lift a skirt\nIt grows tiresome every time you get berserk\nPlus if you abandon home over what was just a flirt (what?)\nWithout a care, I just chuck deuces\nMy skin'll turn numb and you\u2019ll be stuck with what your truth is\nThen you\u2019ll feel a way, thinking I should have resisted\nThen you\u2019ll start to see a side of me you never knew existed\n'Cause you never seen me act like a jerk\nI know women will provoke you and get mad when it works\nRather reserved, and that always makes matters the worst\n'Cause I go on about my business and not act like it hurts\nBut wait, it\u2019s to the point I gotta ask myself\nWhy the fuck is it so easy to detach myself\nMaybe it ain't you, just something I lack myself\nBut if these wounds are self inflicted I can patch myself\nNow listen, I could give a fuck bout how them other niggas treated you\nIf your ass was that perfect they would be with you\nI don\u2019t care if you dime\u2019d out\nYou\u2019ll say you're the best I\u2019ll ever have and I\u2019ll say I\u2019m willing to find out\nWait, I\u2019m thinking bout our bond and what happened to it\nIf you ain't lifting the burden, you probably adding to it\nShe say my logic\u2019s wild and it\u2019s sick to her\nShe say I\u2019m all for self and don\u2019t consider her\nShe feel like she don\u2019t have a voice in this relationship\nI\u2019m thinking boo you got a choice so why you taking it\nCertain shit I wouldn\u2019t stand for\nI\u2019m giving her my all but she demands more\nI wish she would understand more\nCertain shit you couldn\u2019t plan for\nI\u2019m guessing if I love you and you're worth it\nI should take some time out and figure if you deserve this\nBut you just think that I\u2019m full of it\nWe both come from backgrounds of bullshit\nI\u2019m fortunate that ain't what you see in me\nI\u2019ll stop lying to you once you start believing me\u2026\u2026\n\n[Part 2]\nBut I\u2019m always who you wanna bring the questions to\nIt\u2019s less about me hiding shit and more about protecting you\nIt\u2019s totally different the way our minds are made up\nTo me flirting\u2019s natural, to her it\u2019s cause for break up\nTo me it\u2019s human nature, she disagree with the logic\nConfusing being monogamous with being robotic\nI talk to other girls, I interact with 'em\nYou shouldn\u2019t take that as tryna get in the sack with 'em\nJust know how I act with you is how I act alone\nI signed up for a girl not a chaperon\nBesides that plan\u2019ll backfire and I\u2019ll dishonor her\nShe don\u2019t take my word and now I feel I\u2019m being monitored\nAnd I want you to be the one that I endured the longest\nAccept me at my weakest, support me at my strongest\nBring something to the table though, earn ya keep\nThen I\u2019ll triple it and all I ask in return is peace\nAin't with the arguing shit all the time\nYou see I\u2019m honest to a fault but is it yours or mine\nI put you through some things where you could have bolted\nYou want honesty or rather shit be sugar coated\nI\u2019ll put you on a list of people screaming fuck me too\nDo you want a pretty lie or the ugly truth?\nTruth is you got some things that you gotta learn too\nWhen everything that concerns me don\u2019t concern you\nTruth is you gotta a couple tainted views\nAnd you bring up my ex as if I couldn\u2019t do the same with you\nTruth is you want me the dude that kept it realer\nTruth is you\u2019re too emotional and need a better filter\nNo third party will ruin our plan\nI\u2019d hate for you to be the girl who\u2019s too consumed with her man\nSo I want you to have your own plans\nYou to have you own ends, you to have your own life\nYou to have your own friends and I\u2019ll be right beside you\nI can tell that you pride full\nCause you don\u2019t bring up problems that you got with me till I do\nYou say that I\u2019m out a lot and that I ain't here enough\nYou take care of me and I\u2019ll take care of us\nI\u2019d love to put a child in you and live lavish\nBut my baby momma scared me, let me tell you bout my baggage\nWe could have a son and break up and be done\nAnd now I\u2019ll never see him again\nAs you take him and run\nYou gon\u2019 tell him that he\u2019s fatherless\nTell him that I\u2019m cowardly\nYou\u2019ll have some resentment so you\u2019ll start acting childishly\nYou\u2019ll rape me in court cause of course you\u2019ll have it out for me\nTo you it may sound absurd but for me it\u2019s a reality\nStill at times where it seems like you\u2019re not proud of me\nThough I\u2019m showing you the best man I know how to be\nBut you keep saying show me more\nYou\u2019d appreciate me better had you known me before\nYou\u2019ve never been cheated on\nHad another chick in your house in your bed\nYou, you ain't seen the worst time\nHit you with that old move\nTake you to a flick that I\u2019ve already seen with another broad\nBut pretend like it\u2019s my first time\nAnd, nah you don\u2019t know how that sound\nOn the phone with you, while she quiet in the background\nBunch of shit that I ain't in a hurry to do\nSo before you beef, know that he got buried for you\nI dont tell you that for points, nah, you can keep the brownies\nI tell you so that you know I was mature when you found me\nTell you so you know that little boy shit that I get annoyed with\nYou should keep it coy with, cause all that is, is stress for me\nI\u2019m not ya ex baby girl, you not a catch for me\nI mean respectfully, certain shit I\u2019m not a glutton for\nFor every bad bitch, there\u2019s a nigga tired of fucking her\nBut you could be my wife forever\nLet\u2019s grow old live life together\nVacay, catch flights, take pictures\nEverything that my last broad always wanted but got a beef with me when she asked for it..."

You know where your connect live\nTold my ex: \"Don't be bitter, be better.\"\nI replace her before I regret her\nTexts now and then that question how I been\nThe hook sound like a message I would send\n\n[Hook: Tank]\nShe don't put it down-down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you\nGirl, you working with the killer\nAin\u2019t nobody fuckin' with ya\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you\n\n[Verse 3: Twista]\nA down girl, I remember when\nI used to bag up in the basement with her\nWith the attraction of a Michael Jackson swag\nBut in this case a thriller\nAnd she was a wolf, not in sheep's clothing\nBut a gray chinchilla\nEven though I found another assassin\nIt can never be your replacement killer\nWhen I got up in the goods kinda good to me\nBut I know that she don't put it down like you\nCut from the bottom when you up\nWhen you pop on top, \u2018cause nobody around like you\nPulling back to me and I'm all up in it fully\nWhen I'm holding a palm full of hair\nFinna lay you on your back, missionary position\nAnd give it to you good with your Louboutins in the air\nGot a bad new bitch, but she don't be trippin'\nDon't cross with them flaws\nBut she don't be doing the way you be doing it\nWhen you be working them walls\nI\u2019m bumpin' some Tank and I'm plankin'\nI'm fuckin' her good, but then you go frontin'\nSteady cuttin' with bitches all on me\n\u2018Cause I'm with Joe Budden, but what ho wasn't\nI'll put you in the category of somebody\nThat give it to me good but will work a nigga nerves\nIndividual and I'm never particular\nBut I'll never be with her, so I kick her to the curb\nI got a new woman though\nI be building her up to be better than you\nShe fine, but don't know how to throw it back\nSo she can never be you\n\n[Bridge: Tank]\nI done put another in your space\nDamn, after you it\u2019s been hard to replace\nI just want the same judge sittin\u2019 on the case\nShe gon\u2019 hate, but she know\n\n[Hook: Tank]\nShe don't put it down-down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you\nGirl, you working with the killer\nAin\u2019t nobody fuckin' with ya\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you"

It ain\u2019t even fair\nLook good in whatever she wear\nHow could other women compare? They can\u2019t\n\n[Hook: Tank]\nI done put another in your space\nDamn, after you, it\u2019s been hard to replace\nI just want the same judge sitting on the case\nShe gon' hate, but she know\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you, down-down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you, down-down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you\nGirl, you working with the killer\nAin\u2019t nobody fucking with ya\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you, down-down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]\nI can see the stars in the day time\nBitch, I miss you, like a deadline\nAnd the girl I\u2019m with is just the girl I\u2019m with\nI mean it\u2019s working out, so we\u2019re staying fit\nBut you know love is nothing; ask Stan Smith\nBut I gotta keep a bad bitch, like Brad Pitt\nRemember our first kiss? Or our last kiss?\nI used to go dummy in that pussy; crash test\nYou be fuckin' that nigga like you was fucking me?\nHa, fuck that nigga! He can\u2019t fuck with me\nI\u2019m Tunechi, bitch, and you know that\nAnd that pussy throw back\nBut any given night, I\u2019d still pop that ass, like a Prozac\nGirl, you know you got that murder, a beast in that La Perla\nAnd every time we cut, I used to shred her; Ninja Turtles\nAnd I know you still love me, and I know you still for me\nThat\u2019s why we still fuckin'\n\u2018Cause she don\u2019t put it down like you\n\n[Hook: Tank]\nI done put another in your space\nDamn, after you, it\u2019s been hard to replace\nI just want the same judge sitting on the case\nShe gon' hate, but she know\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you, down-down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you, down-down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you\nGirl, you working with the killer\nAin\u2019t nobody fucking with ya\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you, down-down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you\n\n[Verse 3: Joe Budden]\nLove being around mine, no downtime\nStill nothing else even matters\nCan\u2019t even walk slow through that mall\n\u2018Cause paparazzi running after\nBaby girl working it like a pro, slow it down or move it faster\nWhether them lights on or them lights off\nLike I\u2019m sleeping with the clapper\nSay she watching what she eat, yet that ass keep getting fatter\nHow I\u2019m sexing her\nMakes that ex of hers no longer be a factor\nPlus her and I already know, you done turn them all to Casper\nClimb with the former rather latter\nYou already know which one I\u2019d rather cum on\n\n[Hook: Tank]\nI done put another in your space\nDamn, after you, it\u2019s been hard to replace\nI just want the same judge sitting on the case\nShe gon' hate, but she know\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you, down-down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you, down-down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you\nGirl, you working with the killer\nAin\u2019t nobody fucking with ya\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you, down-down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you"

Can't even explain it\nI get more info from words that aren't spoken\nMore fixated on people or things when they are broken\nI used to think everybody was pure\nNow I'm busy tryin' to come up with everybody's cure\nAnd that mindset led to close alarms\nIt be the people you help most, normally do the most harm\nBaited my whole life, most times I ain't bite\nSo no need to stick to a script that I ain't write\nPreconceived notions, nothin' less than a failure\nBase you's off of the cover and miss the best-seller\nWhile I'm at it, let me tell you 'bout this angel I met\nShe was fly, from every angle was fresh\nAnd the way that she was jammin' to the song called 'I'm Not Perfect' made me wanna know what her imperfections were\nNow listen, and they weren't hard to find, y'all\nBoth parents were addicts like mine are\nMi-nor, but her story wasn't new to me\nMost her life, shorty was homeless like I used to be\nCould tell she never felt appreciated\nLooked too much like her dad, was her mom's least favorite\nPicture a bond supposed to be sacred\nLookin' up at your mom's eyes and seein' hatred\nPop left when she was young\nWell, she still young and he still gone, keep it a hundred\nWhile I'm just amazed that a woman so beautiful\nCould go through such ugliness and not become it\nWorld keeps spinnin', learned sinners keep sinnin'\nAnd I can't even tell her some fights ain't fight worthy\n'Cause my pops got 20 years clean\nBut her pops got 20 years dirty\nShe moved to Jersey where he happens to reside\nThinkin' they'll be closer, but it's only fiction\n'Cause she so young all it does is cause friction\nGod picked the right nigga though to teach about addiction\nYears ago she shoulda been on homi' watch\nSo check the time out, just not on Mommy watch\n'Cause someone beat her ass for years, someone calmly watched\nNah, stepdaddy beat her ass, Mommy watched\nI keep her closer than ever, she always next to me\nBisexual, comfortable sexually\nI\u2019m talkin' more comfortable than she should ever be\nEspecially considered the fact she was molested three\nTimes, some things a picture doesn\u2019t tell\nCan\u2019t be worth a thousand words or her pictures might yell\nY\u2019all see a pretty face on Instagram\nI see a girl that should be scarred, never lent a hand\nThere go God\u2019s work again, how\u2019d he know I need that?\nHow the fuck did he pick her to walk me through a relapse?\nBelieve me, shorty, I\u2019ll kill for you if need be\nAnd I need you much more than you would ever think you need me\nWhat I do for you is tangible, shit that you can gain\nYou for me, not understandable, it's shit I can\u2019t explain\nSome folk don\u2019t see the effect in that\nSome say I\u2019m usin' you, they\u2019d be correct in that\nBut what for they\u2019ll never know\nIt\u2019s deeper than nude pics, it\u2019s somethin' I would never show\n\n[Interlude: Joe Budden]\nI figured like this\u2026\nYou came to me at a pool party\nAnd I was two steps away from smokin' on that wet\nMy logic say to me, you came to me as a stranger and I hold you dearer than most people I ever met in my entire life, b\nGod\u2019s work, not mine\nYou came younger and wiser, I'd have never known it\nYou don\u2019t look your age\nYounger and wiser when I was older and dumber\nYou came to me as nothin' I'd have ever wanted\nBut everything I'd have ever needed\nI swear to you its God's work, not mine\n\n[Verse 3: Joe Budden]\nSo you'll never be alone again\nWhat's mine is yours, you won't be without a home again\nAnd I know you from Miami, so you hate the cold\nBut you been through much colder than me and I'm much older\nYou just ride shotgun, let a nigga chauffeur\nI'll cut the grass, you just look out for the cobras\nWe'll be just fine, God set these on our shoulders\nI'll show you a man, you showed me I could stay sober\nLet the world talk about every picture we post up\nAnd we'll sleep well every night, 'cause they don't know us\n\n[Hook: Emanny + (Joe Budden)]\nI give you my all (God's work)\nBut it seems like that's not enough (Talk to 'em!)\nLettin' you get more of me\nSo while the world keep on changin'\nThe one thing remainin'\n(Sometimes you gotta stick around for the miracle)\nIs I keep lettin' you get more of me\n(Gotta wait for the miracle to happen\nGod's work, not mine)\n\n[Outro: Joe Budden]\nI said, God's work, not\nWord, I love you\nI'm gone\nLife is beautiful, ain't it?"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Kenny Powers]\nNew Joe Budden!\nGood afternoon everyone. I'm Kenny Powers. If you're here and you're someone Shane cared about, or someone Shane loved. Or maybe you're just somebody who has no business being here at all who's just here because you think it's gonna make you more popular. You know, Shane and I used to fuck around big time. We fuckin' partied hard. We'd ride our vehicles around. Slay ass\n\n[Verse 1]\nMy condolences, my condolences\nWhole family in mourning send my condolences\nMy condolences, crazy I just spoke to him\nCourtney dropping drinks all in Hooters\nShe losin' focus shit\nDon't send a text, I don't care y'all mad\nShit, I waited 5 days nigga where y'all at?\nFor real, I'm calling Stunna\nCause all Summer 16, ain't heard a hot 16 'bout all Summer\nAwareness is high, say attention I'm seeking\nSince I'm reaching, it's offensive they're convinced I'm a demon\nSuch a thin disagreement, son my kin for a reason\nKilling you is expected of me, I don't win an achievement\nSomebody pinch me I'm dreaming, take this mental reprievement\nSince I know the nigga, I know this ain't the man that I'm seein'\nI heard it straight from the 'Bama's mouth, he won't pull a hammer out\nWasn't you at Hov's show scared to pull the camera out?\nI'm seeing habits switch, magic tricks\nYou froggy behind that Apple fix\nThe passiveness in your manner I might react to it\nAutomatic shit\nRatchet kids at your crib that can't even spell Calabasas bitch\nSo I take all the guns, load half the clips\nI just notice you run, we mention half the Clipse\nI'll save that for another time I'll get back to it\nI'm kinda shocked to look at what we've advanced to\nKnew it'd get you dismantled, knew the issues I ran through\nSick of the scandal, or maybe I just misunderstand you\nI kept it a buck, thought that, that was shit you could handle\nYou said that you wondered if anything you doin' was brand new, right?\nI got him, no one help, father punch below the belt\nIntrospection means dig deep, let's look below the wealth\nI wanna know myself\nHow you tell bitches know they self\nWhen you don't even know yourself?\nYou wouldn't know yourself\nSay he Canadian, maybe Asian, Croatian\nBe sounding like his Jamaican friends, depend on what state he in\nI think you rap good, but you a movie star\nSo that owl's appropriate, we don't know who you are\nWhere did the boy's brain change? Was it the club scene?\nNow you sound like you use people and love things\nBut later for how you use people and love things\nThe entendres that upswing when I call you drug king\nThat record contract, leaves a lot to exam\nNever dealt drugs in his life, but sold a lotta gram\nThat's too much baking soda, good thing my break is over\nThey thinking cause my paper lower, this for Rage to blow up\nOr maybe they just woke up\nYou leverage your celeb, taking waves over\nThat's territorial takeover\nMaybe he thinks nobody notices\nGucci wasn't home two seconds before you rode his dick\nBodied Versace flows, copy, that he stole\nAy dios mio, sorry Migos, adios amigo\nWas that your plot all along?\nWhy you ain't do that vid with Fetty but you hopped on the song?\nNo really, we want a Party album\nBut you keep stealing all of Party's album\nTo go and put it on your party album\nIt's plenty reason to slay you\nKept going up Tuesday's and now The Weeknd just hates you\nAre you lifeless? Sound like a zombie on the track\nRemember \"Started From the Bottom,\" it was Zombie on the Track\nKnow who else started from the bottom? Zombie on the Track\nHow come after that joint I don't see Zombie on a track?\nI'm from Jersey, so Zombie I got your back\nBe alarmed the real is finally back\nGet your guard up now, hope your heart up now\nBattery in him, let's see if he get charged up now\nI'm wake\nI'm wake\nWe at the wake\n\n[Outro: Kenny Powers]\nWho's Goose and who's Tom Cruise?\nWell now that Shane is dead I guess we know who is Goose. Shane is Goose. Cause in that motion picture, Goose dies, so Shane is dead so he would be Goose"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nSome of y'all already know what time it is, though\nWhat up?\nWhat up? It's for hip-hop\nHouse Gang, what up?\nI love this shit, man\nBlack Hippy, what up? (Joey)\nIt go\n\n[Verse]\nSoul of a '70s number man, I can throw a curve underhand\nThis for the streets, not Summer Jam\nThis ain't for the fans that wanna hear pop and snap\nDrunk off Ciroc and the Yak, all y'all can watch from the back\nThis ain't for self proclaimed legends that nobody wanna hear from\nScared? Get a gun; come to peers, I got none\nThis ain't for bandwagon fans sit y'all asses in the same spot\nY'all the same niggas made Trinidad Jame$ hot\nThis ain't to Kendrick Lamar, the nigga Kendrick got bars\nI heard his shit and wasn't offended at all\nAnd as it played I heard him say I wasn't mentioned with y'all\nJoell started it, only right I finish the job\nSo all that shit is revocable, from an overview\nOnly thing noticeable is how he barely gave me any quotables\nI state facts, not to say it's wack but check the playback\nOutrhyming A$AP ain't showing me where your weight at\nI'm on my shit today, you the king of New York\nYou might as well had spit on Biggie's grave, couldn't let that slip away\nI'm in the court of public opinion, ready to click and spray\nLight Jay Elec ass up, that's my Exhibit A\nBitch kill my vibe is what you wanna get into\nDrown em all in a swimming pool, full of phlegm and drool\nYou renting jewels what's with all the fascination?\nSo when I ask you 'bout it that's my cross examination\nThis a scrimmage to me, all these blemished MC's\nInfamously it's about image I see\nBut if it's bars, not about bread, to hell with the wealth\nPut you inside of the bullet just to see a shell of yourself\nI mean, uh, since rap has been accessible\nThey actions been regrettable, this is what the net'll do (Uh)\nChick sending message to tricks ain't get to see 'em\nThey ain't even artists and they get paid per diem\nWe talking bars, then this whole conversation changed\nFuck all the subliminals, now nigga saying names\nSome of these OG's I laugh at, y'all don't know me to half ass\nTo me it's just one Joey that's bad ass\nKing of New York, my nigga stop it 5\nKeep it funky, Drake washed you twice\nTell me Tyler that fire with saliva? I reply don't bring a lie around\nRun up on Meek with the silencer, nigga, quiet down\nThen ride off with his intro playin'\n'Cause I get hype to that shit, dog, I ride to that shit\nWith nightmares, I wanna be at the root of 'em with the mag off\nKnow he love Philly so I'm leavin' him with Black Thoughts\nWe talkin' bars? Niggas better get help\nThey put they guts all on the track, still they never get felt\nLot of lower tier rappers tryna rep for they belt\nNigga there's levels to this shit, dog, you said it yourself\nBut check it, when it comes to control, I might have lost a bit\nLaw abiding citizen style, I'm coming for all of it\nRunning in your studio, engineer that recorded it\nYes men that supported it, any blog that reported it\nAny artist he tourin' wit', snuff whoever bought the shit\nWhoever thought of it, his mentor, whoever taught him it\nInterrupt with a sneeze, hiccup, fart, even cough or lick\nIf I got it twisted you coming to contort the shit\nBut the irony, y'all all inspire me\nY'all in a spot a lot of us aspire to be\nWe just striving, my G, tip my hat so y'all know it's real\nFuck whoever mad, you said how we all suppose to feel\nI know the game, some'll try to get amped\nYou push the envelope, some of us provided the stamp\nThe predecessors wrote the letter, others sealed it shut\nSome was nice without the percs, before Amil got touched\nIt's hip-hop, should blame on the mic these niggas hands on\nShades that they wear in the club, couches they stand on\nYou mixed credibility with dead ability\nRaise the bar like you on par with this level of agility\nOld UNLV Runnin' Rebel artillery, with Augmon at the 2\nWhat sparring y'all wanna do?\nGet to arguing with a Spartan, play it cool\nI heard them alien voices, I'll knock the martian up outta dude\nSeparate the beast from the timid, it's hip hop\nFuck if your car is lease or rented, at least you in it\nFoaming at the lips, looking like the yeast in women\nDon't be facetious most of y'all been a feast from the beginning\nThis is for B.I.G., Suicidal Thoughts, Coogi printed\nThis for Nas, army jacket with the uzi in it\nNot no Shiny Suit shit, this that 92 Knicks\nThis for Hov's missing 92 bricks\nFor State Prop and Beans, to when the L.O.X. first burst on the scene\nFor Queens, Pac and even E.D.I. Mean\nThis for the Mobb and the purple tape, word to Inspectah Deck\nThis ain't for the labels nah, Wu said protect ya' neck\nThis ain't a diss, I don't want it to get spun wrong\nAnd this for Big L, the block that Joe found Pun on\nThis shit is for Stack, I ain't talking a G\nNigga I'm talking a G!! My nigga talking on me\nThis is for every living rapper ever walked in these streets\nAnd any outsider that happen to think that a portion is sweet\nNiggas been killed for less and got a coffin for free\nIf you ever been in the hood, I think we all should agree\nThis for every nigga that took what you said in stride\nI couldn't abide, some of us still take pride, check it\nLimbs'll get crushed, hip hop's adrenaline rush\nMen'll get touched, so if you feminine hush\nProject benches I trust, came from syringes and dust\nSo who you named shouldn't be mentioned with us\nBut wait, at least half of em', other half rapped around\nDual clips that wrap around, gather every rapper 'round\nSee what happen when niggas try to go toe to toe\nThis what happen when you let a blood bath overflow\nUsed to do lines, how could they wanna go blow for blow\nI could overdose and still drag you niggas comatose\nThis is lightweight, put the bucks up\nCause if we talking bars lot of y'all should shut the fuck up\nThis is lightweight, put the bucks up\nIf we talking bars lot of y'all should shut the fuck up"

I just know that, number one\u2014) No, you have a bunch of ideas (no), and that part is apparent, so\u2014 (I don't know, I don't know exactly, I don't know exactly what's happening...) what do you think? (But I know that whatever it is is completely inappropriate for you to do being while you're in a relationship.) So you don't know what's happening? (Of course I don't know. I'm not physically there\u2014) But whatever is happening... (\u2014to see whatever it is. Something is). Something definetly is happening, right? (Something is).\n\n[Intro]\nNew Joe Budden\nOne and two was for y'all\nThis one's for me\nCheck this (talk to 'em)\n\n[Verse]\nI finally found a passion I lacked before\nCan't believe I didn\u2019t catch ya under the act before\nI mean I voiced my complaints, that went ignored\nA few things you felt that you was too attractive for\n'Cause e'erything out your mouth said that you ain't wanna hurt\nLove the lifestyle we lived, but you ain't wanna work\nSo I\u2019d sit you down and say it's getting outta hand\nWhile you shoot down e'ery idea, busy worried about a brand\nWhen ya baby dad said all that shit that was trife\nHow you was married, requesting dick pics from Lyfe\nThough it all seemed shady, maybe I was crazy\nI ignored my gut feelin', nah, not my baby\nAccusing me, but pretending yourself\nI couldn\u2019t catch it, too busy defending myself\nOr was I wrong not seeing a life without you\nOr taking e'erything that you said at face value\nYou packed up and left, dude, I was so glad\nShould've questioned how you easily became a nomad\nIf I could do it all again, it wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve happened so fast\nAnd it burns with every line jotted in this notepad\n'Cause at first you resembled my twin\nFast forward, you gave me identical twins\nBut then you lost it, honestly that murked my soul\n'Cause though we wadn't tryna have one, we got off the birth control\nAnd we was right back at it, fucking like addicts\nWhile you was disrupting what was seeming like a marriage\nYou never got embarrassed, interrogating me but that was just Yaris\nYeah, we beef and I dragged you off the bed\nI swear to this day I re-enact it in my head\nSo I hemmed you up, wasn\u2019t what I aimed to do\nI ain't attack you, bitch, I was restraining you\nBut you was wifey, though I understand that it's not a game\nCan you imagine my surprise when the cops came\nHandcuffed me, you pressed charges\nBut I made bail, it's just heartless\nYou can't smash my laptop on the wall\nAnd then think I wasn\u2019t gonna react, scratch that\nI mean you can't call my mom like can I crash at your spot, whattup\nWhen I\u2019m her son and you just locked me up\nBut wait, this is when it really gets deep\nJudge says she get control of the house for a week\nFiled a restraining order so she couldn\u2019t come near me\nThe fuck else I do but go right back to Tahiry\nI\u2019m sleeping on her couch, not discussing shit\nStaring at the fattest ass, not fuckin' it\nI guess despite everything that she showed me\nIt felt good to be around a broad that really knows me\nI missed all our arguin' and yappin'\nPercocets and muscle relaxers in a napkin\nCan't believe that it happened (why?)\nI lost my unborn daughter when we fought\nI\u2019m thinking I killed Aspen\nAnd that\u2019s when I thought that we\u2019d be dead awhile\nBut we decided to reconcile\nSo hungover from love and what not\nHow could you not expect us to take another shot\nBut during all this time we don't live together\nStupid me thought you'd go get your shit together\nYou know, get a job or if acting\u2019s your career\nSeems you\u2019ve pursued the shit for a year from right here\nAnd it appears, along with all the yelling and the screaming\nWe both at the table, but my side is leaning\nBut rather than end it, we tried to mend it\nFuck bein' a couple, let's work on a friendship\nBut then it got weird, I was stunned from that\nYou took it to a place where there was no coming back\nOff my last break up, I was able to stomach that\nTwo weeks removed and you fuckin' with a running back\nLife is in shambles, disguised as a damsel\nLies are a handful\nBouncing off of, different guys lookin' scrambled\nDespised how it was handled\nBut when you ain't got a dime, why not decide to gamble\nSaid you\u2019d be in L.A. doing business\nI\u2019m thinking that\u2019s great, I can't fault her\nSaid you'd be with Jennifer the whole time\nBut you prob'ly didn\u2019t think that I would call her\nShe said she ain\u2019t seen you since you landed\nAnd for days she been blowing up your phone like a stalker\nAnd all I could do is laugh at myself\nAs I thought, why is old girl sucking off Derrick Ward for?\nSaid we was makin' it right, but you couldn\u2019t\nWas on the phone, I said Skype, but you wouldn\u2019t\nThe puzzle starts coming together and it's brutal\nWon\u2019t Skype, Gmail chat, won't Oovoo\nThe whole time I\u2019m noticing you actin' unusual\nAnd I can't figure out who the fuck you being true to (nah)\nSaid the Wi-Fi was down in the tele\nBut you ain't say you was at hotel his house\nLookin' like a groupie\nOr maybe I misunderstood when you said y'all two was makin' a movie\nLooking at the shit pile I stepped in again\nAnd to top it off your hoe ass is pregnant again? Not again\nI been through the world so I suck it up\nIt's less about the lie more about the cover-up\nSo you busted, but you addin' to the friction\n'Cause you deny it all but you do it with conviction\nSo you talkin' to me real disparaging\nSo what attitude, coming off arrogant\nIf I wanted a trophy wife, then you could be\nBut all it look like is that you renting out pussy\nLess about you, nah, you ain't the one\nYou grown, you got choices, I\u2019m worried 'bout your son\nThat\u2019s what got me up being an insomniac\nLittle nigga can't control how his mommy act\nAs for me, I\u2019m tryin' flush you out my system\nSo I counter by filming all my sexual encounters\nMentally not there while I\u2019m screwing\nAnd I only keep going 'cause that's what your doing\nI\u2019m tryna see how's it done, how's it possible\nEnough to put a weak nigga in a hospital\nStarin' at one ex, talking about another\nBut this one would kill if it meant I wouldn't suffer\nBut she taking little shots, I'm getting ridiculed\n'Cause all she complained about, I went and did with you\nSaid she knew it wouldn\u2019t last when I lived with you\n\"She\u2019s not your type, she ain't got the right hips for you\"\nSo you try and take some'in' for pain, it don't work\nYou still feel it all, the Novocaine don't work\nNope, so we good, I don't let it get me down\nNot a pussy that good nor a titty that round\nFor anything to work, y'all trust is a must\nAnd I learned, gotta let a mutt be with a mutt\nSo I dead that bitch and though the shit\u2019s been over\nSome situations don't end without closure"

It sounded like I was complimenting my contemporaries. [\u2026] You know what it is?

Maybe I'm too secluded\nDo you think you'd be as famous now\nIf you had to put out \"My Name Is\" now?\nThe way the game is now, awful lyrics, shit is shameless now\nJust tell me how you'd maneuver if you came in now\nIt's just thoughts, everything is criss-crossed\nGotta be cool with Complex and Pitchfork if I wanna get my shit off\nThese simpleminded niggas won't think you fuck with us\nIf they don't see you poppin' bottles in the club with us\nIt's about fashion now, which I hate\nBecause I dress like shit, I'm just the best when I spit\nBut different times, I was feelin' like the odd man out\nLike I should leave, they'd be better with the odd man out\nLike when I wasn't on that intro, I felt a little weird\nBut that was for the team, so I didn't really care, for real\nFor the team, how I happen to be\nWhen Bad met Evil, nigga who was happier than me?\nThink back, the way that I was on that shit\nYou woulda thought it was my album and I was on that shit\nLike fuck rap, happy to see a friendship get mended\nCemented and any frivolous tension get ended\nJoell you my G, Weapon Waist you my OG cuz\nNickel you know I look at you like it's blood\nHere's the flowers, before this end is covered in mud\nWe can disband right now and it's gonna always be love\nFor a brief period I tried to rhyme like y'all\nI was high, maybe tryin' to prove that I'm like y'all\nBut I'm not, I suck at all that syllable shit\nI'd rather make the pen bleed to see the feelin' you get\nI'm bein' honest, we might never sell a million and shit\nTo me it's more value in keepin' it trill with my nigs\nAnd to Em, one of the illest ever on the mic\nWe're less different than we are alike\nThis ain't about star power, I ain't on the hype\nNever mind skin color, I see beyond the white\nMy whole life I fought trauma like you\nHad ups and downs with my baby mama like you\nI had my fair share of transgressions like you\nHad a bad temper once and fought aggression like you\nDid drugs, popped pills, fought depression like you\nThese are things you'd never pick up from our sessions in the stu'\nI beefed with Hov, 50, Game and Wu\nGot in my own way a lot, I'm sure the same as you\nThe whole label think I'm crazy, I been peeped it\nI'm only mad I couldn't keep a better secret\nStill when I hear your voice, my head goes wrong\nTakes me back to that little boy with my headphones on\nAnd the way you saved my life back then is how I'm savin' them\nPlaques and charted tracks won't take me away from them\nSo I hope you understand\nFuck this record deal, you inspired me as a man\nI'll cut it short, before I start feelin' like a Stan\nHouseGang for life, word to the pig on Royce's hand\nSuccess'll never disable me\nNo record label will ever label me\nMy morals ain't for sale, can't under-the-table me\nI'll ride it out, even when everything ain't savory\nMy brothers love me, they won't enable me\nAnd they won't kill me, they won't Cain and Abel me\nIt\u2019s how I feel at the moment..."

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMy castle started shrinking, something's gotta give\nEnded up being the smallest place that I had ever lived\nOne of the reasons I would do away with fame, to say the least\nDon't know who these people are, their names ain't on the lease\nIt's a different type of monster, entertainment is a beast\nWas supposed to eat together, then I became the main feast\nIf you preying on my kindness, taking advantage of Joe's cool\nI'd have to ask, what's your definition of soul food?\nI bust my ass for my whole life, and I worked hard for my profit\nAnd envy I know cuts like a knife, so you probably work hard to stop it\nIf you know me like you claim then how could you disregard my logic?\nYou know I cut my arm short and put my heart in my pocket\nA pretty good judge of character, maybe I mistaked a few\nCut some people off, but had no choice, it's what they made me do\nWhy would you take advantage when it's something I'd have gave to you?\nAnd in the long run, it doesn't take from me, it takes from you\nYou'll probably tell me I'm a fucked up nigga\nYou got it wrong, I just won't be fucked up with you\nWhich forces me get distant, and I never want to act a way with you\nBut passion and desire never blends with lackadaisical\nNo longer enable you, that's no longer favorable\nBut pride is on your sleeve so you'll just act like nothing phases you\nWhich can never equal good, in fact\nSo love can't be lost, I know exactly where I put it at\n\n[Interlude]\nWord. Got no problem with nobody though\nSo have no problem with me. Figured\nNo beef, no malice. I got no vendetta with y'all\nSo I only want better for myself\nMight even want better for y'all\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy castle started shrinking, I tried my best to fight it\nDon't know how it happened, don't know how they got invited\nWas good with cabin fever, and maybe that helped create the space\nFuck your good intentions, more concerned with what's taking place\nBut everyone feels entitled, made up their mind they got a right to\nMy peers transforming right before my eyes into my rivals\nY'all can have the cars, yall can have the clothes, take all that shit that I don't love\nI'm learning fast that recognition is its own drug\nAnd what's worse than some of your actions being feminine\nIs I got no way of knowing if your moves are really genuine\nYou there when it's bright, better be there when it's dark\nYou wasn't there for the ride, don't be there when I park\nFigure I love niggas enough to let the world come and stay with me\nAnd I'll stay trapped in this room to keep ya'll away from me\nWhat's supposed to happen when I'm not hot anymore?\nYour job rely on me being crazy, but what if I'm not anymore?\nThe funny shit, them molly's were cool when we all were doing em\nBut nobody recalled when I was the only one they were ruining\nI learned a long time ago in life that not much is fair\nSo no love lost, but not much is there\nDeja vu, this happened rapidly before\nEvery day's a constant struggle and you're a casualty of war\nWhich could only equal good, in fact\nSo love isn't lost, I know exactly where I put it at"

I rapped about it on \"Downfall\"\nBut you know I don\u2019t stay down for long\nRemember you met that other dude\nWho's smarter and more mature, with more bread\nThat you thought would be around for long?\nRemember you pulled the rug from under me, left me to be alone?\nI threatened suicide, begged, was crazy about you\nBut that stalker dude was deranged\nTo the point you wished death on his name\nAnd when we speak now, you still say I\u2019m crazy without you\nMy, my how the tables have turned\nOr are they bendin' just a little? You resent it just a little?\n'Cause dude that ruined your life made you doubt yours\nIt\u2019s the reason that loneliness you gave me is now yours\nCheck it, in perspective I can\u2019t even call it hatin'\nYou mad at the situation, really it ain\u2019t even Kaylin\nWe both sympathized, that pain is felt and shared\nTo watch a man that you helped better display it elsewhere\nWatch a man you spent years with, grew with\nCome across as someone that you want nothin' to do with\nTo sleep in a bed with \"what ifs?\" instead of somethin' special\nHow can you get over us? The public won\u2019t even let you\nI know to wake up with that fear is gross\nLove me from far 'cause you scared to get close\nBut what are you fearin' the most?\nIf happiness is the finish line, I beat you there\nI always thought that when you\u2019d put the baggage down I\u2019d meet you there\n\n[Hook]\nAnd we're off to the races, places\nReady, set, the gate is\nDown and now we're going in\nTo Las Vegas chaos, Casino Oasis\nHoney, it is time to spin\nBoy, you're so crazy, baby\nI love you forever, not maybe\nYou are my one true love\nYou are my one true love\nUh, let\u2019s bring it up to speed a lil' bit\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow a nigga ballin', you still tell me to grow some\nEntertainin' threesomes, you don\u2019t think that it\u2019s wholesome\nSay that you can\u2019t trust me, think I\u2019m out here trashin' you\nGot a lot of answers to questions I don\u2019t be askin' you\nI tried to be friends so I don\u2019t see a problem passin' through\nYou welcome a nigga then paint it as me harassin' you\nYou must be misconstruin' my love and it\u2019s gassin' you\nCausin' you to wear our shit out and think it's fashionable\nI'm thinkin' you should put our history in back of you\nThat would call for you steppin' outside of yourself and bein' rational\nCome to friendship, you question me in that capacity\nHow would you ever know?\nIt\u2019s not somethin' you ever asked of me\nAnd VH1 just gave us another episode\nSo maybe it\u2019s smart that you can\u2019t let this go\n'Cause love changes, a thug changes\nAnd soulmates become strangers, word up\n\n[Hook]\nAnd we're off to the races, places\nReady, set, the gate is\nDown and now we're going in\nTo Las Vegas chaos, Casino Oasis\nHoney, it is time to spin\nBoy, you're so crazy, baby\nI love you forever, not maybe\nYou are my one true love\nYou are my one true love"

   "lyrics": "[Chorus: Emanny]\nI give you my all, but it seems like that's not enough\nNow you can get all of me\nA lot of things have changed from what I see\nIs this the way its supossed to be\n\n[Verse: Joe Budden]\nAre you in that mood yet, one mo' 'gain\nARE YOU IN THAT MOOD YET\nLook, they say tomorrow's not promised, but if it was I wouldn't get open\nWouldn't get souped, them shit's was made to be broken\n'Member comin' up dudes talkin' 'bout hoes, boastin'\nI was just a Juvenile movin in slow motion\nI dropped outta school to be a dude with mad jewelry\nOnce I got it shit wasn't even cool to me\nI dreamt of condos and video vixens\nUntil I learned most girls in videos is pigeons\nI just wanted the world to see that I was for real with it\nWanted a deal, I got it and couldn't deal with it\nI want me and my old homeboys to still kick it\nI wish they saw me as Mouse and not a meal ticket\nLet the beat play, I wish I could see a day wit no he say, she say, just wanna see Trey\nWanna play the hood and not fuck with the toasters\nMiddle child, wish me and my brother was closer\nI wanna scream at her, catch myself before I start to\nAnd then remember it takes two people to argue\nAll she do is provoke me, all I do is diss her\nAll I did was shake her, she say that I hit her\nShe just takin' everythin' I say out of context\nI'm tryin' not to black, I'm like a nigga with a complex\nWas mad as a fuck, didn't even show it\nYesterday was better off, didn't even know it\nComplete role reversal so it's useless these days\nTV got real, music went fake, please help her for God's sake\nWhen I proposed to the game I figured life was merry\nFive years later I'm feelin' like Tyler Perry\nMaybe I'm exhausted, maybe I just lost it\nMaybe I should pick up a pen and try n' force it\nSame old story, guts and no glory\nThey tryna low ball me, do him like Joe Torre\nI reintroduced myself to the world: I'm Jerz\nI'm an artist, I paint pictures, I don't rhyme words\nMore than a rapper, I pay attention to detail\nBut how I do in retail tells me if I prevail\nLeonardo ain't seen these trials and tribulations\nFoul situations with some mild stipulations\nI feel like being an addict is a curse\nIt's somethin' 'bout dude that makes bad shit worse\nThere's three types of niggas in this world, you know?\nSo you either gon' make shit happen (or)\nWatch shit happen or (or,) not know what happened\nSo I couldn't just sit there like, fuck rappin'\nIt's dudes with problems I couldn't imagine havin'\nIf I had to have 'em I couldn't fathom me lastin', like\nI used to bump into Tammy in the club\nFew of them, she even helped a nigga get in\nSee a person long enough you know you bound to get fly wit 'em\nCare for 'em, be more than \"hi\" and \"bye\" with 'em\nIts been a while, I can't front like I ain't phased\nShe was my reality check, 'cause we the same age\nI mean she put on a show that you can't stage\nShe made the shit sound effortless\nI was damn near in tears checkin' my messages\nI got goosebumps all over my skin\nShe said, \"Mouse, I highly doubt that I'll ever see you again\"\nHope everything is well, kid\nYou see I'm just findin' out I have a brain tumor, but I never felt it\nThe doctor's giving me three weeks to live\nNot three weeks 'til I die, that's three weeks to give\nI just wanna tell you that I love you and I care\nI wish you all the best throughout the rest of your career\"\nAnd then she broke into tears\nI pressed seven, took the phone from my ears\nSometimes the simplest of things people need it\nBut I ain't call back in fear of being speechless\nWhat was I to put her at ease with\nI picked a real bad time to be strategic\nI think my life's bad, picking up the pieces\nSome folk already got they appointment to see Jesus\nIn this world full of diseases\nI've learned not to bite my tongue or have seizures\nDepression tells me I suck\nSo I reply, I ain't here 'cause I fell down, I'm here 'cause I got up\nAnd then I'm goin' back and forth with Ransom\nShit came outta nowhere, was real random\nAccording to him, I'm responsible for Jerz too\nI never helped niggas, how the fuck you think they heard you\nMotherfucka's got a lot of nerve, dude\nI was the nigga believed in you spittin'\nHad to con the industry just so they would listen\nBut go 'head, you just gon' rep yourself\nHow was you protecting me, you can't protect yourself\nKeep the lies to a minimal, just read your interview\nI can't help but ask what's gotten into dude\nMedia trainin' but he don't know how that go\nIt'd help you come across not soundin' like an asshole\nIn my past though been to jail, I ain't enjoy it\nSo why would I stand behind the mic and exploit it\nI ain't ig'nant, just because I exercise spiritually\nThey try to ignore how I exercise lyrically\nI thought I had a great job\nBack when niggas loved the culture, wasn't in it for the money like a A-Rod\nEven when I'm spitting 'bout current events\nIts a sublime sayin', who's more current than him?\nSo I'm wonderin', if a higher power tryna under-man\nWhen you shoot for the stars, sometimes your gun'll jam\nI ain't been to Summer Jam\nI learned from Lupe: when you dumb it down its just harder to understand\n2008, foes is still near me\nSo you can think I'm tight as FUCK, I'm still weary\nThe Geto Boys say its all in the mind\nCertain wounds only heal over time\nNo shame in my game, no pain, no gain\nAnd since I ain't see a prophet I figured God would stop it\nWaitin' on a alley, niggas just won't lob it\nStill a risk taker let me put it in words\nCan't steal second base and keep your foot on first\nBeen about ten years since I was high off the angel\nNow I'm walkin' side by side with an angel\nIn front of my eyes that prize keep gettin' dangled\nBut can't grab at it, my pride is being strangled\nWorkin' shorty's nerves like a personal trainer\nBut its me, its personal, it ain't her\nFriends keep tellin me leave her, I won't\nCause she sees somethin' in me that I don't\nAnd I see somethin' in her that ya'll won't\nIf you never been in love don't tell me I'm wrong\nSee I preach gratitude, she keeps an attitude\nArgue long enough and that shit becomes laughable\nMy norm now since for her it's so natural\nWish I could tell her that all them niggas after you\nSo not compatible, that we compatible\nIts nothin' else in this world that we would rather do\nAnybody out there relate to my pain\nTurn the music up let me know that I'm sane\nWe broke up, bitches was starin' at my chain\nDude was fuckin' you but starin' at my name\nBut we ain't gotta entertain all that\nBack like we never left, we overcame all that\nFuck who made better tacos or who's ass fatter\nLet's live for now, right now, none of that matters\nKeep bringin' it up its goin' backlash us\nWhy am I meeting so many back-stabbers?\nWhy when I'm about to crash I go faster? Past is a disaster\nWhen your house is see through, learn to close your eyes\nIn case the Glass shatters\nJust sayin', it's always a million more pages when my stupid ass keep\nThinkin' I'm on the last chapter\nNo tit for tat, I ain't equipped for that\nBack in New York, chit chat with a Midget Mack\nAs I get older...I keep gettin' sick of rap\nWanna call it quits, but a nigga can't picture that..."

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Child's voice]\nMic check, mic check\nOne two, one two\nNew Joe Budden!\n\n[Bridge: Joe Budden]\nUhh\nPlease somebody help my soul\nPlease somebody help my soul\nPlease somebody help my soul\nPlease somebody help my soul\nTalk to 'em (talk to 'em)\n\n[Verse 1: Joe Budden]\nI let the Man have a talk with the beast in me\nI'm holding onto my last bit of decency\nI need a vacay, a change of scenery\nBut mama said wherever I'ma go, I'm taking me with me\nI told her shit is on my mind and it's been eating me\nShe got me pissing in a cup, she don't believe in me\nIt's not the drugs that got me out of my zone\nGoing days without eating, in a crowd I feel alone, mama\nThen she ask why it seems I never sleep at night\nI told her when I close my eyes my brain just keeps the fight\nShe said my friends wanna have an intervention with me\nI speak to niggas daily, that was never mentioned to me\nShe told me there's a higher power and a lower power\nAnd that I'll die if I don't find the strength to overpower\nThen I replied, \"well aren't we all\"?\nShe said \"yeah, but that should be on God's terms, not yours\"\n\n[Chorus: Emanny]\nMy every thought is scary\nAnd it makes it hard to breathe again\nLike I'm blinded while I'm staring in the mirror\nAsking God to help me see again, please help me\nBut He tells me I'm only human\nAnd that I'll be back on my feet again, please help me\nBut they act like I'm more than human\nI prove them wrong again\nDon't fault me, I'm only human\n\n[Verse 2: Joe Budden]\nTryin' to weather the storm\nI thought that black cloud was gone\nIt's been beside me all along, not the song\nI wanna sit in silence, don't speak for a minute\nTired of being strong, please let me be weak for a minute\nKinda thought that my disease tried to kill your man first\nIt was easy to get my hands on 30 milligram Percs, worse\nCan't be depression, couldn't have it this long\nSo many secrets I only told to a glass of Patron, my nigga\nSpeaking of secrets, that's when I got the Kaylin text\nRead it and cried, couldn't believe what she was saying next\nShe said \"you're going through a lot\nI'm hoping you ain't in the grave and dead\nCause not too many people know your brain's a mess\"\nWho knew that she was keeping track of it all?\nI wrote back \"lol\" but wasn't laughing at all\nI ain't tell her just the other day that that gun was in my lap\nPen and pad in my hand, and I was writing a note\nDidn't get far, as soon as I wrote down \"mom\" I just stopped\nCouldn't lie to her, couldn't figure out how to say bye to her\nCouldn't explain the \"why\" to her\nCouldn't picture her getting a call or somebody saying her son had died to her\nAnd shortly after that my pastor called\nWhich at first I kinda thought it was weird\nBut that convo preserved me, 'bout God's grace and mercy\nHe ain't even say goodbye, he said \"let us pray\"\nAnd then he went into a prayer, gripped the phone, closed my eyes\nJust so happy he appeared, nigga shed another tear\nMaybe he could sense that something had the god devoured\nJust thankful he shed some light upon my darkest hour\nAll my thoughts are corrupt, this shit is whack\nIf everybody calls you a duck, will you just quack?\nGuess a part of me really gives a fuck, way in the back\nCause when I had that burner ready to bust, I didn't clap\nJoe\n\n[Chorus: Emanny]\nMy every thought is scary\nAnd it makes it hard to breathe again\nLike I'm blinded while I'm staring in the mirror\nAsking God to help me see again, please help me\nBut He tells me I'm only human\nAnd that I'll be back on my feet again, please help me\nBut they act like I'm more than human\nI prove them wrong again\nDon't fault me, I'm only human\n\n[Verse 3: Joe Budden]\nGuess I'm insanity's definition\nTrying to step over in sanity's repetition\nBut I can't it got me tripping\nWhatever love we had was dead that night\nLooking back, we both needed cooler heads that night\nWas going off no sleep, eyes red that night\nWhile you was drunk texting me, I hope I read that right\nYou was beefing bout Giselle, beefing bout Alexa\nSuddenly you was jealous, must've thought that I had sexed her\nI was laughing, thought it was funny\nGiselle's the homie, Alexa's twenty\nWith hip withdrawals\nNothing bout your story shoulda been sticking at all\nI wouldn't dick her at all\nI'm guessing, maybe you were insecure and never knew me\nWas there for four months, yet you said this was a new me\nIn your head, guess the answer to this jealousy\nWas to turn around and try to make me jealous, B\nBut the part that you neglect\nWas never mind jealousy, this was 'bout respect\nY'all Instagramming pictures, trying to get me upset\nYou turned that into a night we both would never forget\nWe both said some things we both probably regret\nYou was lying to my face and them dots didn't connect, but cool\nOnly picked you up to try and talk sense into you\nNow I'm fucking homeboy up, just off the principle\nI guess he caught him self antagonizing me\nBut he's a young nigga, that's no surprising me\nShit I done fucked some of the baddest hoes\nI left shorty weeks ago, you can have this ho\nI guess the part where I lose\nIs now they got my face plastered all over the news, I'm being falsely accused\nAnd I don't understand, was this all part of a plan?\nI guess I'll tell the whole truth when on the stand\nHow you go and tell the cops I had guns in my house?\nNow they got a search warrant, just to come to my house\nQuestion: were your feelings worth taking my tomorrow's, kid?\nAnd you know Jersey gun laws, I'm talking hollow tips\nSo you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want\nBut you and I know what's going on\nNigga that whole night just replays in my mind\nYour face is fine, this is a big waste of time\nLet's get back to that jealousy\nNow you got a nigga facing three felonies\nAll for what, cause we were no longer dealing\nYou attack me, but I'm the villain, over a fucking iPhone and feelings\nCheck, you never see me act like a jerk\nI know women will provoke you and get mad when it works\nRather reserved and that always makes matters the worst\nCause I go on about my business and not act like it hurts, but wait\nSo now the whole world is watching me get burned here\nWhich is fine, there's a lesson to be learned here\nWhich is only fuck with strippers and the bartenders\nAnytime there's a pole in the bar centered\nSo even though it's from afar now\nI still wish you the best, I know your heart's tender\nI'm sorry all, I just got my own scars to tend to\nSigning off, truly yours, with love, God's sinner\n\n[Chorus (Extended): Emanny]\nMy every thought is scary\nAnd it makes it hard to breathe again\nLike I'm blinded while I'm staring in the mirror\nAsking God to help me see again, please help me\nBut he tells me I'm only human\nAnd that I'll be back on my feet again, please help me\nBut they act like I'm more than human\nI prove them wrong again\nDon't fault me, I'm only human\nMy every thought is scary\nAnd it makes it hard to breathe again\nLike I'm blinded while I'm staring in the mirror\nAsking God to help me see again, please help me\nBut he tells me I'm only human\nAnd that I'll be back on my feet again, please help me\nBut they act like I'm more than human\nI prove them wrong again\nDon't fault me, I'm only human"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Joe Budden]\nQuarter on the loose\nLoose Quarter\nFew questions I ask myself\n\n[Verse 1: Joe Budden]\nMaybe it started with Slaughterhouse, or was it tour life?\nMaybe it wouldn\u2019t had started at all if I had your life\nMaybe it was needed, or was I thinkin' immorally?\nIf I wasn\u2019t myself, could I say I gave the fans all of me?\nCan\u2019t decide if I\u2019m more ashamed of what they saw of me\nThan I am of ignorin' all the lessons that was taught to me\nHeaded up field but couldn\u2019t dodge the last tackler\nHow could a forward thinker move so ass-backwards?\nHow could a dude with no regrets at all, willin' to bet it all\nNot realize that quicker demise? How could I neglect it all?\nI\u2019m so seasonal, some of y'all knew I'd spring back\nWith a heart this cold, how'd y'all think I\u2019d be receptive to fall?\nI\u2019m plenty comfortable when danger\u2019s around\nAnd even more so when strangers around\nAnd the bigger picture is sicker\nDon't know my triggers or know the alarm it forces\nDon't know a nigga\nDon't know my bouts with drugs and liquor or the harm it causes\nLife or death, I tried to lynch myself\nThought I could keep it all a secret, I convinced myself\nBut really, the folk that loved me, they could tell I was locin'\nI couldn\u2019t see him cry me a river 'cause it fell in the ocean\nNumb to my words now, maybe felt I was open\nI cut so many people loose, do I need help with devotion?\nThat\u2019s just some of the things I ask my Lord and Savior\nAnd when He calls for me, will He have done us all a favor?\n\n[Hook: Kobe]\nHow did I make it here?\nWho are y'all?\nI feel so lost\nNow I\u2019m not seein' it clear\nIs it my fault?\nIt\u2019s all in my head\n\n[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9\"]\nI\u2019m lookin' around like this can\u2019t be happenin'\nRound of applause for the angry rappers\nLord, my girl cried me a flood, then me a river\nThat\u2019s love, dependin' on me when I\u2019m independent on liquor\nI\u2019m up in the shoe store, she got no love to show\nYou ever look at a bitch you was fuckin' behind your bitch back\nLike, \"Fuck I was fuckin' you for?!\"\nI\u2019m an artist so I\u2019m intelligent\nI would tell you to do some soul searching\nBut it\u2019s hangin' up in my closet with your skeleton\nIt\u2019s gotta be a God's work\nEven a diamond gotta be polished first\nA quarter's on the loose\nAnd I ain\u2019t been out here gettin' my dollars worth\nI had to remove the goggles first\nTo see through the sippin' Patr\u00f3n\nAnd fifty phoners for I need to go get me a kidney donor\nGuru, Nate Dogg, go ahead blink a eye\nThe doctor told me, \"You close, go 'head drink and die\"\nBuried under the stone where the Patr\u00f3n fifth sits by\nThat reads, \"Here lies somebody who never wanted to be this guy\"\n\n[Hook: Kobe]\nHow did I make it here?\nWho are y'all?\nI feel so lost\nNow I\u2019m not seein' it clear\nIs it my fault?\nIt\u2019s all in my head\n\n[Verse 3: Joe Budden]\nThey say knowledge is power \u2013 great, 'cause every day I learn\nAs of late been havin' revelations 'bout this hate term\nHate the way they judged me 'til I got the case adjourned\nHated the belly of the beast 'til I became its tapeworm\nWhen I said I\u2019d stop gettin' high, tried to say it stern\nNow I\u2019m the type to walk through the fire to check the way it burn\nThey say my brain is off \u2013 I say, \"How can it be?\nIf I\u2019m out my mind, how can I be in-sanity?\"\nThe people used to say that I was scared of progress\nThey don\u2019t know how hard a nigga tried to advance\nBut I don\u2019t know who\u2019s more to blame\nIs it them for really not knowin' me?\nOr is it me for never really givin' them a chance?\nGet too close, be too big of a threat\nNow it\u2019s been little to no time, thinkin' why I ain\u2019t get rid of you yet\nGotta recognize my maturity, gotta see I\u2019m grown\nLet all my skeletons out the closet just so I'd never be alone\nSince I got trust issues I won\u2019t discuss with you\nBesides God, tell me who the fuck\u2019s supposed to save you?\nPop won't have a man-to-man, was gone half my life\nSo somewhere in his head probably feel it ain't his place to\nPlus more people will see me soon\nI mean, I\u2019ll be on national TV soon\nSo when I ask if people I have around are a cancer for me\nThat\u2019s four million more that might be able to answer for me\n\n[Hook: Kobe]\nHow did I make it here?\nWho are y'all?\nI feel so lost\nNow I\u2019m not seein' it clear\nIs it my fault?\nIt\u2019s all in my head"

How was none of it factual?\nEven in our demise, it seems I'm always attached to you\nThey said: \"If you let it go, if it's real it comes back to you.\"\nShe just called me a thief; I took it, never gave back to you\nAfter all that I've done, figured you'd have some gratitude\nLook how far we fell off, we can't even be casual\nGuess we both had times we were being irrational\nWe both out of our minds, how are we not compatible?\nSay I pushed you out the door, and you did what you had to do\nNow you play the victim like I wasn't impacted too\nShould be a movie star, ma, you so good at acting new\nYou like us as strangers, me, I think it's impractical\n\n[Refrain: Joe Budden]\nBut she said that she deserves much better\nFor as long as she fought\nGuess our bond wasn't as strong as I thought\nWe'll never know, come on\n\n[Chorus: Katelyn Tarver]\nWe're broke, like skeletons, loving to the bone\nOur heart's so delicate from hanging on too long\nNothing left to hide, nothing left to show\nWe're broke, like skeletons, loving to the bone\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh\u2026 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\u2026\n\n[Verse 2: Joe Budden]\nI mean, we started with love, then we ended with hatred\nThe whole world in our business, clearly nothing was sacred\nI know you down to your core, unless for years you just faked it\nI know all of your flaws, see your soul when you naked\nNow you got a new squad, all them bitches is basic\nAnd even if they ain't, it ain't hard to mistake it\nI think you running from love with me, you gotta face it\nAre you guarding your heart\nFrom a nigga that always breaks it?\nNow you live in the club, maybe you tryna stay busy\nYou still call me every birthday to say that you miss me\nYou check to see who I'm with, \"Did anybody come after?\"\nBut still talk like you the one, you say that none of them matter\nI guess it is what it is, what about what it could be?\nDo we try this again, just to confirm what it should be?\n\n[Refrain: Joe Budden]\nBut she said that she deserves much better\nFor as long as she fought\nI guess our bond wasn't as strong as I thought\nWe'll never know, come on\n\n[Chorus: Katelyn Tarver]\nWe're broke, like skeletons, loving to the bone\nOur heart's so delicate from hanging on too long\nNothing left to hide, nothing left to show\nWe're broke, like skeletons, loving to the bone\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh\u2026 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\u2026\n\n[Bridge: Katelyn Tarver]\nI'm the one you hide\nThe one you can't forget\nAnd you're the reason why\nI lie awake in bed\nYou never felt so open\nI never been so scared to death\nWe pushed so hard\n'Til there was nothing left\nUnder my skin, gave what I had to give\nWe hit the end...\n\n[Chorus: Katelyn Tarver]\nWe're broke, like skeletons, loving to the bone\nOur heart's so delicate from hanging on too long\nNothing left to hide, nothing left to show\nWe're broke, like skeletons, loving to the bone\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh\u2026 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\u2026"

   "lyrics": "[Produced by AraabMUZIK & Karon Graham]\n\n[Verse 1]\nTo my dear dearly departed\nShit's becomin' all that I feared, here's where it started\nSeems that nothing's as it appears, swear it's retarded\nNo wonder I get speared by my peers, yeah I'm a target\nIt used to take a nation of millions for niggas not to be\nAmeriKKKa's Most gave America hope\nBack when the music had a message in it\nWe was rebels against it\nThe best was intended to lessen the gimmicks\nBut now y'all made a mess of it\nAnd somebody gotta address this shit\nRakim would never wear a dress and shit\nI ain't a pessimist to say I ain't impressed with it\nYour hearing's bad, you think it's alive, now that's the death in it\nWhen it was all about bars, wanted to weddin' it\nSurround yourself with bullshit, you'll be liable to step in it\nCame here with one objective, gettin' it further\nNow I'm watchin' my first love die, witnessin' murder\nWhen Common stopped lovin' ol' girl, what was he tellin' me?\nCold world, now she won't dig you without a melody\nLove nerds, used to be into niggas with felonies\nWe need a new president, where the fuck is Eric B?\nOr did my wordplay confuse her?\nNow I see her with Young Thug and Future\nLike what did you niggas do to her?\nNow, my generalization is this generation\nThe imminent state of this gentrification, desensitization\nI call her, she's in Marvin's room, everything is awkward now\nShe moved more to south, deserted her New Yorker crowd\nMet her with a cane, she changed, prefer to walk it out\nStopped eatin' meat when she heard I worked in a slaughterhouse\nNow she's a new dame glued to the fame\nShe used to hate accessorizin', now she's wearin' two chains\nRelationship too strained, I don't know who to blame\nWhen I tell her, \"You changed\", she say, \"Who would be the same\"\nShe right... cause this ain't the way we knew each other\nOr do I face the fact that maybe we outgrew each other?\nIt took a while, but that's finally understood\nShe wouldn't change if she could\nI swear if this is love, I'm good\n\n[Hook]\nEverything has changed, I can see it clear in fact\nStarin' at these four walls, angry that they're starin' back\nTook a while, now it's finally understood\nWould we change it if we could?\nI swear if this is love, I'm good\n\n[Verse 2]\nLook, I can't get with you at all, our issue is tall\nYou tied to every nigga now that dribbles a ball\nDid I miss a red flag? You wasn't fickle before\nI can't even ridicule y'all, that'd be a bitter resolve\nWanna talk about our history\nI feel like everything you say is contradictory\nWhenever you come visit me\nI look at you and see remembrance, remnants\nPlenty resentments, it's not you but there's resemblance\nWe diss each other all out of fun, shit amuses me\nYou threaten every girl I'm with, that just confuses me\nSay you want kids real soon, now that's abuse to me\nAnd I just write about it in song, you're like a muse to me\nI wanna ask where you see yourself in five years\nHow you goin' about that, like what's the verdict?\nI wanna ask if you ever replay the past over\nAnd if you do, when you finished is it worth it?\nI wanna ask if we love each other so much\nHow do we cause each other so much pain?\nStill in all in each others lives\nWe've remained without a claim\nI know some'll call that clinically insane\nHow do we remedy the games?\nWas once enemies and then that energy refrained\nWasn't meant to be, the synergy had us mentally drained\nMinimally sprained so relentlessly he aims\nDespite when you said you never could depend on me again\nStill we're here as none of this had ever taken place\nAre we checkin' to see if someone's takin' our place?\nAs we front like we're takin' up space\nI think currently the current we is makin' our case\nBut for what? Would that just seal it again\nDid it all hurt so much? Do we wanna feel it again? I doubt it\nTook a while, still nothing's understood\nWould we change it if we could?\nI swear if this is love, I'm good\n\n[Hook]\nEverything has changed, I can see it clear in fact\nStarin' at these four walls, angry that they're starin' back\nTook a while, now it's finally understood\nWould we change it if we could?\nI swear if this is love, I'm good\n\n[Verse 3]\nLook, I can see the pain in your eyes, I wanna fix it\nBut all your words are fuelin' my pride, so I'm dismissive\nYou think I wanna sit in this courtroom\nTalkin' supervised, scrutinized by suit and ties? You a lie\nYou could cry, the conditions of you and I, can't escape it\nEvery lie she told you over the years, I'm face to face with\nAnd now they manifested\nYou're overwhelmed and congested\nBut feelin' neglected, I gotta respect it\nI can't explain to your so young brain\nSince our first exchange you've been kept from me\nUsed against as weaponry\nAnd as much as I hate her\nI'd never downplay your mother like that\nFor you to judge her like that\nJust a lesson later on that you'll discover like that\nWe not alone in this process, no, it's others like that\nBut you spew these sly remarks like, \"Why are we here?\nLike why are you near? Like why do you care, how is this fair?\"\nI gotta eat that, see you got a grudge, lil' nigga\nWe flesh and blood, lil' nigga, no ifs, ands or buts, lil' nigga\nYou can think your dad is nuts, lil' nigga\nI'm talkin' to you cause you came out of my nuts, lil' nigga\nThat's my stance on the matter, I won't budge, lil' nigga\nAnd I'll tell that to your mother and the judge, lil' nigga\nAt our next court date, you gon' see that it's true\nFunny, my condescendin' ways, I kinda see 'em in you\nMannerisms when I'm annoyed, yep I'm seein' that too\nI'm smilin', admirin' genes, I kinda think that it's cute\nI was you 20 years ago when pop popped up\nBut nothin' like you, sad how life'll recycle a cycle\nYou missin' intel only a dad can give\nCan't expect you to understand, this doesn't matter to a kid\nAnd since our situation's not understood\nI would fix it if I could\nI swear if this is love, I'm good\n\n[Hook]\nEverything has changed, I can see it clear in fact\nStarin' at these four walls, angry that they're starin' back\nTook a while, now it's finally understood\nWould we change it if we could?\nI swear if this is love, I'm good"

(said)\nShe said she woke up when she heard\nBut she was so damn tired she couldn't make out a word\" (out a word)\nShe said she was tryin to see if eventually I would scream the name of a bird (bird)\nI told her that's absurd ('surd), and then gave her the face like \"word?\" (word)\nAnd then she replied yeah, said it was quite weird, said she was type scared\nI said \"that's a side effect that you get\nWhen you trade bad dreams for some great nightmares\" ('mares)\nWhen I close my eyes (eyes), I escaped the Poltergeist\nMy escape from reality, just what I needed\nBrings me to a place where shorty never cheated (hey!)\nAnd even if she tried and succeeded\nIn this other world I wouldn't even get heated\nFuck (fuck) the details, I don't care about why\nI'm chillin' with my grandmother, she ain't die\nI was browsing online and seen Mike on a banner\nThat said \"you can be like me and beat cancer\"\nAnything I touched I'd feel (feel)\nKnow it\u2019s fiction, but it seemed so real\nWas leavin' out the casino with a nympho\nYes, Rae, it can be so simple (oh)\nHere's how I avoid a problem with my kinfolk\nLearnt how to build me a house with no win\u2014dows\nAnd that's when I think I saw a ribbon in the sky but it wasn't from an in-tro\n'Cause where I'm at is no rumors or gossip but still got love for Ms. In-fo\nShe said in my sleep I'd be laughin, but shit be funny to me (oh)\nLook, my ice cream was two hundred degrees\nIf it dripped, I'd get a hole in my dungarees\nSee, my anonymity is my protection (what else?)\nAnd me and hip-hop have no connection (what else?)\nWhich got me to reflectin, is that why the mirror won't show my reflection?\nWhen I close my eyes, there's no dollars\nSo we can scratch that one as an excuse (or)\nOr why folks do the things they do (or)\nOr why people act so brand new (let's go)\nI had wings on flyin out a prison with a ratchet\nWas only there cause someone snitched\nLook (look here), no one's poor but no one's rich\nJust my way of creepin if life's a bitch\nTook a walk on the ceiling just to get my mind right\nThat was yesterday (so), so in hindsight\nSince I was able to haul off\nI took it as God tellin me I'll never fall off (off)\nGot rid of name brands in the jewelry (why?)\nMost people just use it as medicine\nLike it take 'em somewhere they ain't never been (but)\nBut here you better off not better than (oh!)\nStuck in the room with a elephant\nOpened the closet and dapped up my skeleton\nHad a convo with a man with no ears\nAnd all of a sudden everything became so clear (clear)\nHave no fear, I just bought a first class trip to nowhere - everybody goes there\nBut they don't stay the whole year, me? I got three hundred and sixty-five shows there\nMy girl said in my sleep, I'd be walkin (walkin), so I ask baby, where I go?\nUh, she said I be walkin slow\nBut she don't ever want to get out of bed, so she don't know\nI went to see a man walkin on water (and)\nAsked if he'd ever get things back in order (and)\nI've been there two years, over a quarter\nBut everytime I open my eyes, it's like torture (torture)\nHe said \"please, I gave you a whole 'nother world for you to go do with as you please\nJust so you appeased, mixed with a couple of signs about real life while you make believe\"\nSo I (so I), teleported out of there with a grin\nMet a bum with a mansion, invited me in\nThen (then), we politiced, about politics\nSaid somethin about Def Jam, I ain't acknowledge it\nI went to see a virgin with AIDS, yeah I thought about smashin that (why?)\nYeah her ass was fat\nSo appealin, tattoo on her inner thigh said\n\"she doin better than she was feelin\" (feelin)\nI think I seen shorty before (like), maybe in a club or somethin\nOr, maybe in VIP, but wasn't nobody there but me\nAnd the club was all red (red)\nThen she started playin with my head (my head)\nAnd then I came\nThen I asked shorty, \"what's her name?\"\nAnd it was weird cause she fucked around, disappeared (uh, 'peared)\nLike what a cruel joke (look)\nCig lit but from it was no smoke\nFlicked in the ash tray and seen Stack's face\nFlash through a school hallway on a half day\nWas gettin chased, couldn't tell by who (or)\nThen a hallway turned into a cliff (what else?)\nScreamin' piff before I was dead\nSomehow I jump my ass up out that bad\nThen baby girl told me in my sleep, I was screamin (screamin)\nSo I said that's a lie (that's a lie)\nShe put her right hand in the sky and said \"you was, but I don't know\nWhy, got to go, goodbye\" (goodbye, goodbye ...)"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Ab-Soul]\nLook at me, King!\nLook at me, King!\nSoul\nKaylin on the couch sleepin'\nShe wake up, she gonna be like damnnnn\n\n[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]\nCome and spar with a titan\nIf you ain't knew it's true I'm Zeus and I marvel at lightning\nWhat a marvelous sight, know the thought is enticin'\nFlow stupid like 50 Tyson, don't trip with 50 Cent\nI beat 'em all like Tyson, that's no coincidence\nAb-Soul, don't forget the hyphen, I might throw a fit\nYou think I lived in the Salvation Army but all it is\nIs that we got a new 2Pacalypse Now\n(When?) Before the apocalypse\nWow, how do you come up with this?\nIf you behind Ab, then maybe you can stomach this\nWho could fuck with it?\nI know you got a dick, but use your head, bruh\nThey sleepin' on me by a colony of bed bugs\nCut from a different cloth and no one knows my thread count\nMy mind is like a sword, you'd swore I'd have a hair cut\nSoul and Budden, no discussion\nJoe, you know it's nothin'\nWrote the score, and then I scored, metaphor, and 1\n\n[Hook: Ab-Soul]\nI don't know about you, hey, I don't know about them\nI just do what I do, they just do what they can\nThey be hatin' on the man, with a knife in their hand\nCut from a different cloth, cut from a different cloth\nAll these niggas on my dick, all these bitches on my balls\nCut from a different cloth, cut from a different cloth\nMiddle fingers to the fakers, middle fingers to 'em all\n\n[Verse 2: Joe Budden]\nY'all can hold the applause\nI just did what these other niggas was scared to do\nTell me life is hard, I'll ask: \"What the fuck do you compare it to?\"\nQuarter on the loose, I'm blessed enough that I can spare a few\nTold me I'd be dead, the fact I'm breathin' is a miracle\nY'all got Gollum, listenin' to all these dudes that y'all call lyrical\nExcludin' under conclusion that you young and you dumb\nIf that's how they appear to you\nI'd be lyin' if I said your words ain't bother me\nBe lyin' if I ain't think it was trickery or reverse psychology\nI came in on Rakim, watched y'all take the bar, y'all lowered it\nWon't stay in line like a battered wife\nAin't too many spots y'all can go with it\nHow long y'all gonna febreeze manure\nAnd think the fans won't notice it?\nNah, I ain't get angrier, but the chip on my shoulder did\nNot to gloat, if I ain't one of the G.O.A.T.S.\nY'all probably missed my track record\nEither that or y'all just ain't been keepin' track of records\nI've just been waitin' till that sentiment passed\nY'all ain't even gotta be drunk to feel this genuine draft\nI'm lettin' Benjamins stack\nShouldn't be hard to tell if the boy is potent\nI'm the only time you'll see a madman be void of emotion\n'Cause they fear me in any cypher the hear me in\nOnly rappin' with Soul for the outer body experience\nSo hats off, y'all fit for this, but y'all the type we laugh at\nI'm way ahead, and when I aim for yours\nSomethin' tells me he won't snap back\nAll I ever been was a outcast\nThis time in the moment I moved past that\nBut the burner name is Jackson and your alias is Baghdad\nBLAT! It's not a game, try to execute\n2K'D my old bitch, know I keep a ex to shoot\nIf anyone tried to do the math they'd probably be mad as fuck\nSaid I'd never amount to shit, now they tryin' to add it up\n\n[Hook: Ab-Soul]\nI don't know about you, hey, I don't know about them\nI just do what I do, they just do what they can\nThey be hatin' on the man, with a knife in their hand\nCut from a different cloth, cut from a different cloth\nAll these niggas on my dick, all these bitches on my balls\nCut from a different cloth, cut from a different cloth\nMiddle fingers to the fakers, middle fingers to 'em all"

I hope not\n'Cause most of mine were hunger driven, nothing in my mother's kitchen\nStomach sounds like the clouds ignited and the thunder hittin'\nSo the well-screwed kid ended up with more than a couple missin'\nSo not a chef but now the cocaine forever cookin'\nI love kids but now I'm selling to a pregnant woman\nStumbling through the projects in the AM with a cup in my hand\nGun on my waist and \"I don't give a fuck\" is my plan\nYou'll never understand my palm sweat\nFollowed by shortness of breath then my heart jets and I ain't find a calm yet\nGo on, let shorty sing\n'Cause ain't no way in hell this ain't Joell, that's brave enough to tell you everything\n\n[Chorus: Kaydence]\nI got some skeletons locked in the closet (Yeah, yeah)\nAnd I've been dyin', dyin' just to find an outlet (Yeah)\nAnd I'm hoping that no one finds out about it (Yeah, yeah)\nWishing maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it\nI doubt it\n\n[Verse 2: Crooked I]\nFuck all that rappin', I'ma let the conversation rock\nI got skeletons in my closet\nThe living dead live in a nigga head, behind a combination lock\nWhen will the occupation stop and make it a vacant lot?\nThe black mamba when I crack vodka, I'ma take a shot\nAnd hope them stowaways go away before the anchor drop\nYo, thanks a lot, I'm a bottle-drinking nutcase\nCover of XXL behind Em, I had the drunk face\nI steadily dream about cleaning these demons out\nIn order to clean them out, you gotta scream and shout\nAll of your secrets out loud\nIt started as a kid at my school desk\nAced every quiz but I wanted to pass the cool test\nAin't nothing cool about school shopping at the thrift store\nAnd living in an abandoned station wagon because you was piss poor\nSo I started stealing all of the clothes that the other kids wore\nThat's when the skeletons moved into my mind on the sixth floor\nAnd more came through Crooked I's youth\nI slowly started moving them out my closet into this mic booth\nFor real, bro\n\n[Chorus: Kaydence]\nI got some skeletons locked in the closet (Yeah, yeah)\nAnd I've been dyin', dyin' just to find an outlet (Yeah)\nAnd I'm hoping that no one finds out about it (Yeah, yeah)\nWishing maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it\nI doubt it\n\n[Bridge: Kaydence]\nI thought I had it all locked away 'til forever\nBut no memories fade away, they seem to stay\nComfortable in my conscience you live in my dreams\nThey say time heals it all then why's the pain still with me?\n\n[Verse 3: Joe Budden]\nUh\nSee the problem is, I know it all\nOr maybe the problem is that I just show it all\nMaybe they that thinking I should be ashamed of my actions but really there's no remorse\nMaybe the Lord will decide that I suffered enough and let me live with no withdrawals\nThen again all it would mean is he deemed I'm much too important to focus on\nWe could talk about pain 24/7 dog, that\u2019s my department\nInter city blues cruise and I\u2019m blasting that Marvin\nSkeletons ain\u2019t in my closet, that\u2019s my apartment\nAnd they like to hide behind thousand dollar fabrics and garments\nIt's all bleak to me, tell my Pop, I ain't bothered\nWhen he don't speak to me, I love you but it\u2019s weak to me\nOn one hand life is short and there's no excuse to do it\nBut you was missing half my life dog, I'm kind of used to it\nModern day Son of Sam, judge but you don\u2019t understand\nMe against the world, I plan on winning, know I'm undermanned\nWant to see through the eyes of a monster? Look through my glasses tint\nMy roommates can stay here, just take care of half the rent\n\n[Chorus: Kaydence]\nI got some skeletons locked in the closet (Yeah, yeah)\nAnd I've been dyin', dyin' just to find an outlet (Yeah)\nAnd I'm hoping that no one finds out about it (Yeah, yeah)\nWishing maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it\nI doubt it"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nMic, mic, mic\nYeah we good now\nTurn the vocals down a little bit, just a little bit\nI want it loud\n\n[Verse 1]\nHere's my moment of clarity\nI've been misleadin' you all, givin' you half of me\nI've been blazin' a trail and leavin' casualties\nI've diagnosed myself, I think it's apathy\nSo lettin' go became easy, grabbin' ahold that's the hardest\nI know our expiration date soon as we start it\nYou come around and you feel safe while you're a target\nYou feelin' like I let you inside, while I'm guarded\nIt's genius when arrogance seems like it's modest\nLook past the insanity, glance at the logic\nAppears optional, all of it is stipulated\nWatch and learn how emotions get manipulated\nNow you in dire need of help\nYou the victim, made to think you did it to yourself\nSpeakin' of, rest in peace Sandra Bland\nMe I'm believin' everything that wasn't on that cam\nBut back to you, beauty, let me address our lil' movement\nYou in therapy but I don't see the improvement\nOh whatever's been made now days is ruined\nSo every few months I ponder what the fuck are we doin'\nLet me watch my words again\nYou easily got one of the best pussies that I've ever been inserted in\nYou real kind, real sweet, real nurturin'\nYet every time we link back up, you just get hurt again\nYou put all men in a box, I ain't one of 'em\nFunny how you got all the answers and none of 'em\nYou only dated three men so I'm scared of you\nCause with no point of reference, what the fuck are you comparin' to?\nYou good one minute, psycho the next\nNo longer lettin' it ride, too much Jekyll and Hyde\nThen you subtweet for weeks, busy settin' your pride\nI'm grown, don't really need that sort of mess in my life\nBut wait, you of age, you old too\nI control my emotions, yours control you\nYou bright enough to know when you get impulsive\nFor me, that's repulsive, how do you not know this?\nAnd then we go our separate ways\nJust to link back on better days\nThough I know it's short term and you never stay\nYou always a sucker for that text that say\n\n[Pre-Hook]\n\"Yo what up? Are you good?\nHit me up whenever you in the hood\"\nThen we fuck, and it's fine\nThen you get all this bullshit on your mind\nI'm waitin' for you to talk, but you won't\nThen you wait for me to react but I don't\nThen you go, and I watch\nWe know how this movie go, but we watch\n\n[Hook]\nCause we just playin' our parts\nYou're watchin' how I perform and it's breakin' your heart\nYou home alone backtrackin', replayin' the start\nYou realize this whole script you've been playin' a mark\nThat ain't stop you from takin' a part\nI guess we're both just playin' our parts\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, and so the pussy ain't enough now\nThey keep thinkin' it should be enough, how?\nFuck sex, baby, later for that\nThis mind game I'm playin' is a greater climax\nNot a franchise player, I can't pay you the max\nI can't say it to you so I just say it in raps\nI got a rep that I made all by myself\nOne I hate all by myself\nThat comes from decisions created all by myself\nI can't shake it all by myself\nSee I grew up in the spotlight\nWhere your every move is eyed\nThe truth becomes lies when you're that scrutinized\nNo mentorship, I was unsupervised\nHad to learn on my own every rule to survive\nStill I manned up in caught those wrongs\nGo ahead and judge Joe, I got my court clothes on\nY'all see the front, behind the scenes more goes on\nCheck my back catalog, it's in all those songs, forreal\nSo I can be at peace forever\nI left the puzzle right there, nigga, piece it together\nBut back to you, beauty, small waist, fat booty\nIt's cool for the moment but don't permanently move me\nThey come through tossin' me ass like it's their duty\nBut who I was ain't who I am, I say it truly\nHere I am shootin' 'em down without the Uzi\nUnlike them niggas you know, don't try and group me\nWatched myself on TV, was unruly\nHow the fuck they cast me wrong in my own movie\nThey say you are what you attract\nHere I am, screamin', \"fuck all that\"\nThen I'm forced to believe I attract and adore\nBunch of unstable broads with character flaws\nWith plenty luggage, I greet 'em with their bags at the door\nIf that's true then it's some shit I'd rather ignore\nCause check it, whatever helps you get by\nSo when they hit me, I always reply\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nThey always be like, \"what's up? Are you good?\nHit me up whenever you in the hood\"\nThen we fuck, and it's fine\nThen you get all this bullshit on your mind\nI'm waitin' for you to talk, but you won't\nThen you wait for me to react but I don't\nThen you go, and I watch\nWe know how this movie go, but we watch\n\n[Hook]\nCause we just playin' our parts\nYou're watchin' how I perform and it's breakin' your heart\nYou home alone backtrackin', replayin' the start\nRealize this whole script you've been playin' a mark\nBut that ain't stop you from takin' a part\nI guess we're both just playin' our parts\n\n[Verse 3]\nJust where I'm at lately\nLook at the monster this industry done made me\nShit I loved the most, I let it jade me\nCryin' out for help, somebody save me\nBut I can't let 'em know all that\nThey take it as weakness when you show all that\nSo I just live in my mind 'til this hoe call back\nEvery time I'm knocked down you see Joe crawl back, forreal\nNowadays they all the same\nEnhanced body parts, smaller brains\nThey don't get a hi in fact\nMums the word, baby girl, it's now quiet for that, forreal\nIf you got nothin' to offer\nSorry Mrs. Jackson, gotta off ya\nBut as soon as you leave 'em alone\nIt's when they send that same text to the phone\n\n[Outro]\nThey always be like, \"what's up? Are you good?\nHit me up whenever you in the hood\"\nThen we fuck, and it's fine\nThen you get all this bullshit on your mind\nI'm waitin' for you to talk, but you won't\nYou wait for me to react but I don't\nThen you go, and I watch\nWe know how this movie go, but we watch\nCause we just playin' our parts\nI guess we're both just playin' our parts\nI play mine well\nBetter than you\nAnd it go... baby, baby!"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Joe Budden]\nJust when I thought I can't dig any deeper\nSaid my last shit was trash and they dig when it's deeper\nThey ain't see what I see, I guess my vision was weaker\nOr they buy me to hear me, so we can skip all the features, I'm like\nWoke me up with the pinch\nSo it's in English now, since they ain't wanna hear French\nAin't wanna hear Wiz, ain't want me with Kirko\nThey ain't wanna hear me happy, now they lookin' for hurt, yo\nThey'll hate it before they hear it if they think it's commercial\nAnd so they're patiently waitin' for my fortune's reversal\nCheck it... it's like ever since Bundles passed\nTook the high road and watched everybody underpass\nTruth be told, God been lookin' out so much\nThat I feel guilty when I ask him for more\nThen I do it like the shit ain't ever happen before\nThis is all the while layin' on my bathroom floor\nHold up, I'm just askin' him, give me strength to grow up\nBy now I'm sick and tired of layin' in my own throw up\nIt's a given, then self pity hits me\nAnd I start to feel like I don't deserve to be forgiven\nLike when you can't think, talkin' when you don't drink\nBut sneakin' 'round your own kitchen cause you gotta get a swig in\nI got issues, weed and vodka will settle some\nWell ain't that the pot callin' the Kettle One?\nI know niggas so broke that they embezzle funds\nToo busy waitin' for a chance that ain't never come\nBut this is bigger than havin' a debt\nI mean I can't stop my brain from imaginin' death\nThen out the clear blue sky I cry random tears\nUsed to it, me and depression been a tandem for years\nI suffer from self doubt, put a cramp in my fears\nIf there's a God, this would be the perfect span to appear\nI'm not a street nigga, never claimed that sport\nAnd some of that train of thought's insane, had to abort\nSo people say I changed, I believe I should\nEven so the goal's always been to leave the hood\nNone of this should be a shock to y'all\nLogic says if you're still there, that's a knock to y'all\nSince you want a nigga furthest from his dreams\nLove's gone, DOA once we left the murder scene\nJoe\n\n[Chorus: Joe Budden, Rafael Lavoz & Emanny]\nWhen the love goes, the trust goes\nIt's like you hit my heart with a snub nose\nI don't give a fuck though\nWhere did the love go?\nGuess it's all love lost\nBeen a hustle, a struggle\nSay the truth hurts and then cuts slow\nI don't give a fuck though\nWhere did the love go?\nGuess it's all love lost\n\n[Verse 2: Joe Budden]\nNow this might be the realest shit I ever said\nEver thought, realest I ever fought\nIgnorance is bliss, you niggas were never taught\nSo when a challenge is sought, you niggas never retort\nMe I'm too savvy, too witty\nIt's just too much moxy\nNo percs, just a few crushed oxys\nBut gettin' off was imminent\nWhen my dick became numb I was impotent\nShit got real different then\nWas out in Cali with a model, little waist\nAnd double Ds, a pretty face and long hair, name's Vivian\nNot the norm for me, askin' what's wrong with me\nTried everything we could, nothin' worked, couldn't get me in\nWe went on so many tours high\nThat chemistry we once had, did it all die?\nSomething's changed, I just can't put my finger on\nAnd I'd be wrong to sing a song but let it linger on\nJust know I'd die for my brothers\nTake on the whole world, at least try for my brothers\nJust wanna know that that's reciprocated\nAnd if that ain't the case, nigga, say it\nThese just words from the heart\nMy life coach say I never finish what I start\nWork, school and relationships become one\nBut if I took all I could, how'd I leave it undone?\nI'm givin' all the love but not receivin' any\nBut then they mad I'm all for self and I don't bleed for many\nShit I done made a couple of you bitches\nJust by tellin' folk I was a couple with you bitches\nBefuddled and so now I don't want trouble with you bitches\nHad I used my better judgement, I'd have muzzled all you bitches\nI gave out careers, fixed your fashion\nDid this shit so much you would think I got it patented\nSo many loved and mentioned me\nJudged but can't sentence me\nReal nigga never cared\nWorth a couple mil' and started from an idea\nKeep it candid in the booth, never panic, I'm the truth\nGod starin' down on me through a panoramic roof\nI copped to the murder, red handed, ain't no proof\nLove's dead but you never understand it 'til it's you\nTrue colors never hide for long\nWhen tables turn, ain't gon' matter what side you're on\nAnd for me that's a reoccurring theme\nLove's dead, I'm just walkin' y'all through a murder scene\n\n[Chorus: Joe Budden, Rafael Lavoz & Emanny]\nWhen the love goes, the trust goes\nIt's like you hit my heart with a snub nose\nI don't give a fuck though\nWhere did the love go?\nGuess it's all love lost\nBeen a hustle, a struggle\nSay the truth hurts and then cuts slow\nI don't give a fuck though\nWhere did the love go?\nGuess it's all love lost\n\n[Guitar Solo: Jeremy Kolmin]"

One of the first songs that was leaked off of Mood Muzik 4, \u201cBlack Cloud\u201d, like the mixtape, is about Budden\u2019s entire career but it also focuses on his experiences (with rappers, beefs, and his hot ex-girlfriend, Tahiry) over the last few years.

I\u2019m concerned with niggas havin\u2019 fake in common\nThough I\u2019m leading I don\u2019t really know the path\nBut the future can\u2019t be worse if you really know my past\nBegged to be understood anytime I showed the wrath\nBut how could I expect third parties to know the half? (Ayy)\nLike, when the temp rises, but you the candle wick\nSorta like Kyle Williams out in Candlestick\nE'rybody shouldn\u2019t grab the hammer by the grip, shit!\nBilly Cundiff couldn\u2019t handle the kick, shit\nThey say I changed since stardom\nCan\u2019t share the same success, we ain\u2019t share the same problems\nSo, got big just to show \u2018em what the gym does\nNever mind shootin\u2019: they ain\u2019t show me where the gym was (Ayy)\nThat\u2019s why I do a lot on spite\nSo if you look up to me, you got \u2018em at the wrong height\nI mean, I\u2019m not a role model (Nah), I\u2019m a piece of shit (Nah)\nA product of never being given a piece of shit\nBreaking day got the grind of a trucker\nAnd my logic ain\u2019t designed to intertwine with you suckers\nLoaded nine is a buffer, but no time for you fuckers\nThere\u2019ll be bodies in the sewers when my mind's in the gutter (Owww!)\nLast night I had an epiphany\nThen wrote it in my rhyme book in calligraphy (Ayy)\nI see so many people looking for validity\nThat\u2019s the wrong search if what\u2019s lost is dignity\nI certainly have grown since Mouse\nChrome under the couch (But I...)\nBut I\u2019ll stomp his face to make it known what I\u2019m about\nIf he on what he spout\nPut my Nikes on his cheeks, now he foaming at the mouth (Get it?)\nUgh, reminded when I vent\nNigga, God designed it, it's in the print\nTwo memos for the spineless, one's repent\nSecond jewel: even my kindness is a strength, nigga!\nNo beef, no malice, not at all (Not at all)\nI got no vendetta for y\u2019all (I promise)\nI mean I only want better for myself\nSometimes, I even want better for y\u2019all, I swear\nThere\u2019s no love in hip-hop\nIrony, not even on Love and Hip-Hop (Nope)\nSpacious closets, Persian rugs\nMake sure I\u2019m dressed at my best for the jerks that judge\nHad a talk with my ex and knew for certain I was bugged\nSo I let the door slam feelin\u2019 worse then I was\nShe said all I ever made her feel was hurt and disgust\nWhich in turn hurt cause that was my version of love, I cared\nClear, yeah, that you need better resolution\nIt seems the chances, we agree, are forever ruined (Ugh)\nYou talking 'bout how, I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about execution\nYou talking 'bout now, I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about evolution\nUgh, but better days gotta come\nI\u2019m a good amount of bad, right amount of so wrong\nAnd Heidi Klum left Seal, which only prove my point\nShit can only be ugly for so long\nSlaughterhouse founder, can't derail the captain\nAin\u2019t enough niggas praying I fail for it to happen\n'Cause on both sides of the coin you\u2019ll get fed shells (Bow!)\nIn unison, hollow heads from redtails\nI don\u2019t wanna see your weapon\nTo keep me from what I\u2019m destined\nSome\u2019ll see that as a blessin\u2019 (Ugh)\nAnd my dudes swear they\u2019ll keep me happily from harm (So)\nSo I do the leg work, they carry the arms (Brrrat)\nCheck it, shorty I had over Saturday\nNever act away, and squirt \u2018til she oversaturate\nShe go hard in the dark, no chains\nBut see I\u2019m gettin' it, even when the car is in park, nigga!\nThe hood is on some bullshit\nSo it ain't weird to see \u2018em aiming at the pulpit\nFates are empty, collection plate, spirit in ruins\nWe used to a different type of communion\nWhen guns take the place of the choir, tie up the pastor\nIf he scared, can't believe what he say \u2018bout the life after (Oh)\nThe stained glass is bulletproof\nSometimes, a liar's mouth can be full of truth\nI done heard gospel from a sinner\nTold me to season my pride if that\u2019s dinner\nSaid there\u2019s no human that walks without sin\nSo we should probably call the gates, make sure we allowed in (Joey!)"

Or just willing?\nNo blinds, no bags, just dealing\nNo foundation or floor plan, just building\nCheck it, nights bright, but the days dark\nCovered in tattoos, but hate art\nThese eggshells I walk on are razor sharp\nStaring at the finish line, looking for a way to start\nI've been called everything, an extremist\nIs that a bad thing or what they really mean is\nAnything a nigga do, a nigga mean it\nAnd I won't let a person, place or thing come between it\nAn opportunist is how they paint me\nBut if the nigga only knocks once can you blame me?\nStill I feel like my problems are great\nShit, if I don't never solve em' I'm straight\nOn the bright side God choose me to put a lot on my plate\nSo he had to figure I wouldn't be bothered by the weight\nI'm trying to change the pattern but it's on loop\nEven an outcast in my own group\nWhat's it mean when ey'body standing next to you expects of you\nEverything that comes wit a spectacle?\nIf everywhere I go, I just leave behind residue\nTell me, trust me, I won't think nothing less of you\n\n[Hook]\nI'm sorry I ain't around more\nCome up with me, or stay on the ground floor\nI don't need shelter from the downpour\nY'all can be whatever you want, just not my downfall\nThey tryna make me slow, tryna take me, no!\nCan't be my downfall\nThey tryna knock my grind, I won't stop, I'm fine\nCan't be my downfall\n\n[Verse 3]\nNo moment of clarity\nThe next fight showing is a rarity\nSeverity in me against my growin popularity\nRappers won't rap, I'm forced to believe they scared of me\nBut can no longer use the scape goat, 'They not aware of me'\nSo y'all can go and throw your little pot shots\nSome dudes dissed me and temporarily got hot\nI'm getting my head right, recollecting\nY'all looking for some website resurrection\nBeing that I got too much to lose\nOr maybe a slight chance that a nigga guilty of all that I'm accused\nNo longer amused, affected my loved ones\nNow they startin' to bruise\nAnd I don't want no parts of that abuse\nWouldn't wish upon my worst foe, a day in my shoes\nThat'll just eliminate any excuse\nAnd why entertain em'?\nOld me would'a lost my senses, y'all just helping the new me regain em'\nBeen punched in the face\nIt was either feed my family or hunt wit the .38\nI ain't want brunch to wait\nI've out grown Hip-Hop, it turned into a Day-Care\nSo next time some shit is on my mind, it'll stay there\nI'm staring at the man in the mirror\nBut it ain't helping see the man any clearer\nSo I get M.I.A from around y'all\nTill God stops answering these prayers for my downfall\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 4]\nTell me what am I to do\nIf I ain't have a soul a nigga always had you, pardon due\nBut I gotta speak candidly\nHow the FUCK could you abandon me?!?\nWit 5 years of blood, sweat and tears\nBut it was obviously a disconnect\nWe turned that into a disrespect\nSaid she been holding it inside for years, she's unhappy\nSo the girl I wan' marry was afraid to come and tap me\nSo I went away on tour, and you went on one of your own\nBut while you was on the horn all day wit ol' boy\nDid you ever think about what it would do to your home?\nWhat's his name? Where's he live?\nWhat is it he offers? What's he got to give?\nAnd I love you so much that when I caught on to your fibs\nI hit you like a man, you wore it in your ribs\nI was heated\nBut had to be strong enough to remove the infidelity and see what's underneath it\nCome to find out you felt lied to and cheated\nMistreated, and kept it a big secret\nOr are you just loose?\nAnd I'm so naive I'm tryna give you an excuse\nNow that I refuse to believe, we life partners\nHoly water on whatever devil come and try to part us\nCan't use anything I ever gave you to bury me\nYou supposed to be the one to bury me\nYou wan' leave? Then goodbye\nThink the grass look greener on the other side, but it's dye\n\n[Hook]"

Yes I am\nI see your life from far and something's off with it\nIt's my fault and shit, I shoulda never altered it\nI sold a dream when you couldn't have known the cost of it\nKnew my love came with a pain and I still offered it\nSeein' your weight loss, knowin' I'm the cause of it\nIf that ain't my signature, then shit, somebody forgin' it\nBut you think I ain't hurt, like it ain't no guilt in me\nLike it ain't killin' me, I'm out here on a killin' spree\nA sickness, I ain't found a way to nurse it yet\nLike I ain't a nervous wreck, like it's no reverse effect\nInternal bleedin' and the cuts run deep\nEvery time I leave one love, a loved one leaves\nI wish I could take the pain away, but only yours\nI'll be fine if I remain this way\nSee I deserve whatever punishment I get\nYou could sentence me to years\nOf hearin' my vic's voice even when nothin' is there\n\n[Hook]\nI still picture your affection\nI still hear you like we're talkin' on the phone\nStill feel it\nLike you're right there holdin' on to me\nBut words cannot explain\nWe will never be us again\nEverything has changed\nOr is that just you givin' up again?\nMore unnecessary pain\n\n[Verse 2: Joe Budden]\nI done gone so long not givin' a fuck\nThat it's no longer erratic, now it's a normal habit\nEven when I go my way, I gotta have it\nBury me with my sweats on and bitches in the casket\nAll the waiters and words, I let 'em loom on\nEvery verse real enough to write it on my tombstone\nAnd so you know how real that paranoia be\nEven make me think my demise is avoidin' me\nThe sick part is I withstand that abuse\nLong as the fans are amused, am I a man or a muse?\nNever sugarcoat it when I hand it to the youth\nFell from all over the world, and always landed in the booth\nI hold music in such a high regard that\nTo this day I still feel like it's destiny\nAnd to these fans that I once gave my life for\nI gotta tell you that it's not much left in me\nYeah, and not that it's growin' old\nBut years of bearin' my soul is takin' it's toll\nTook a father from his son, but is it best that way?\nI'm so fucked up inside I can't regret that Trey\nHold my head up high at the gates after my time's up\nThey say you saved somebody's life by givin' mine up\nWouldn't be the first time that I went without\nChased my true love so much that I resent it now\nYou can put this in the scriptures like it's sacred\nTo live with it, but hate it is to giveth then to take it\nGoin' through the motions, it'll strip a nigga naked\nI guess it's for a cause if all the kids are gonna play it\nTrust me, I ain't been the same yet\nYou'll stop and stare any time you see a trainwreck\nAnd I'll take whatever punishment they give\nYou can sentence me to years\nOf hearin' that fan's voice even when nothin' is there\n\n[Hook]\nI still picture your affection\nI still hear you like we're talkin' on the phone\nStill feel it\nLike you're right there holdin' on to me\nBut words cannot explain\nWe will never be us again\nEverything has changed\nOr is that just you givin' up again?\nMore unnecessary pain\n\n[Bridge]\nStill learnin' to live with\nPeople coming in and out my life\nThe ones who matter show it over time\nThat's why they always stay on my mind\nSo I live in reality\nNobody else matters to me but you, you, you\nWhy try to hide the truth?\n\n[Hook]\nI still picture your affection\nI still hear you like we're talkin' on the phone\nStill feel it\nLike you're right there holdin' on to me\nBut words cannot explain\nWe will never be us again\nEverything has changed\nOr is that just you givin' up again?\nMore unnecessary pain\n\nI'm tried of feeling this\nI gotta live with this"

Rider\nWashed up on marijuana\nEven worse, you a Pervis Ellis\nYou worthless fella\nYou ain't no athlete, you Shawn Bradley\nAnd I ain\u2019t talkin' to nobody in particular\nMy flow's just vehicular homicide when I\u2019m kickin' up DUST!\nAnybody in my path Is a car crash waiting to happen, nigga what?\nI got my foot on the throat\nOn the pulse of this rap game and I ain\u2019t letting up, YUP!\nYeah, who\u2019s the nicest life or lifeless on these mic devices?\nAnd I don't write this I just mic this\nI will it to happen\nOne take Hov I\u2019m real at this rapping\nMy new name is just the facts\nWhile the rest of y'all just adjust the facts\nPut words together, just to match\nI say what I feel y\u2019all adjust to that\nI do the opposite of y\u2019all so I just attract\nThe realer audience usually unjustly black\nKnow my flow and the shit they go through just match\nLike the sound of my voice and a choice Just track\nI just tackle the subject the flack of the public\nNothing, I know real niggas happen to love it\nIf you don\u2019t like it then look in the mirror\nMost likely you ain\u2019t live it so you don\u2019t get it\nYou ain\u2019t did it so you can't vision it\nThe picture I\u2019m painting ain't vivid\nThe language I\u2019m spitting is so foreign to ya\nSee what starving'll do to ya\nGrowin up hard in a little apartment'll do to ya\nI\u2019m just talkin\u2019 to ya\n\n[Joe Budden]\nGimme that beat fool\nIt\u2019s a full time jack move\nSorry Jay, Webb said take it back dude\nHa\nNitti too, he played a part in that\nListen I\u2019m just having some fun\nNo\n\nPart in the future\nSing the track now\nIt's been a good week Hova\nYou can give it back now\nAll these rappers is cooking crack and\nTook the realness out the game it\u2019s time to put it back in\nThe fans finally got it understood they just yappin\nWhile Joey\u2019s in the hood like Madden\nWhoa\nSuccess is wrapped up\nChecks just rack up\nEverybody\u2019s a killer but the deaths don\u2019t add up\nEverybody\u2019s a hustler but the money ain\u2019t coming in\nY\u2019all is it just my math sucks? Nah\nIn time I'ma super-succeed their wealth\nLike everybody\u2019s so scared to just be they self\nAdd the bass in your voice get found like the cool\nSo we could sound like loon or pound like boom\nDon\u2019t end up a dead man for the cheddar\nOnly way to play Joey's Def Jam Vendetta for real\nOn your Pro Tools lose, and don\u2019t be shocked\nOpen the booth door we be like old school move it\nI ain't Kobe or Tracy, Jay-Z, JB merk\nJoey the future I\u2019m more like Dirk\nAnybody buyin respect me\nTry and wet me\nY\u2019all dudes will never make it\nY'all a Tyus Edney\nI\u2019m a standout like Yao Ming, I\u2019m what's sparking now\nLike fall back Shaq, I\u2019m starting now\nBoys poppin it toys poppin spit\nI\u2019m not from round these parts I\u2019m Stojakovic\nNever hear your man say I\u2019m the Jordan of rappin\nHe\u2019s gettin fatigued early and his scoring is lackin\nLegacy is gettin' ruined and you don\u2019t want that\nSo pretty much learn from him, don\u2019t come back\nAnd rap is gettin\u2019 wack, time for Gs to step in\nCause\u2019 you are not that hot, don\u2019t believe the yes men\nAin\u2019t about who\u2019s better than uh, it\u2019s so evident\nThey hard to be real with no evidence\nAnd I ain\u2019t comin' at Jay, 'cause he\u2019s the greatest breathing\nBut he already paved the way, I\u2019m just layin' my cement\nNot the same way I was dude I\u2019m done drivin' now\nI\u2019m in your 745 plus 2\nDon\u2019t have your label call mine for no extracurricular\nRappers is all girls, extra particular\nSeen many men with the jake\nNext time y'all listen to \"Many Men\" I'll make sure you relate\nOnly Jay coulda came Just Blazed it like me\nEverybody else chills, Just Blaze can agree\nPackin a MAC in the back of the Acura, no\nClappin' the gat you be wrapped in the caddy but naw\nWhat you want punk double clip pump\nRide by slump forth cocked playa on top\nHater warm rock with his teeth toes wrapped\nWith the brand new savior of east coast rap\nDon\u2019t worry y'all  I\u2019ll bring the east coast back\nNah par, this ain\u2019t a movie but meet Joe Black\nTry to relate to it I just speak those facts\nIf you was in the front now your seat goes back\nWhat the deallin'\nLike New York been soft since Bin Laden came thru and crushed the buildings\nTrying to restore the feeling, just speaking to ya\nI\u2019m just speaking through ya"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nGood evening\nHow's everybody feeling out there\nY'all good?\nI talk my shit again?\n\n[Hook: Eric Bellinger]\nI really don't know where we should go from here\nIt feels like time is escaping\nI don't want to waste it nooooo\nBut in the back of my mind\nIt feels like, like we should just let it go\nWhere do we go?\n\n[Verse 1: Joe Budden]\nYou ain't gotta adore me or keep it friendly\nAnd even if you ain't for me, don't be against me\nYour people tell you ignore me and say it simply\nBut you get lonely and call me, that always tempts me\nWe get caught in the moment and then we fall back\nThen I get horny and you take that as a crawl back\nNow there's an irony hidden if you can call it that\nI walk all over you, yet you be on my doormat\nAnd unbeknownst to you, that whole plan of attack\nShe sayin' only with me does her sanity lack\nHer truth come out when she drunk, but I amnesty that\nI talk logic and she screamin' profanity back\nNow when I think long term, you can't hand me that\nBut for now she need a crutch\nThere I am to take advantage of the handicap\nJust me givin' you truth, I don't demand it back\nGuess I'm just a fan of facts, hope you understandin' that\n\n[Hook: Eric Bellinger]\nI really don't know where we should go from here\nIt feels like time is escaping\nI don't want to waste it nooooo\nBut in the back of my mind\nIt feels like, like we should just let it go\nWhere do we go?\n\n[Verse 2: Joe Budden]\nCheck it, I'm like royalty around y'all\nDown to fall with niggas I feel as loyal as me\nWhich is prolly why loyalty is my downfall\nGot few friends that be coyin' me to count more\nBut steel sharpens steel, let me sound off\nStill gotta question your will and what you're down for\nIt's real, I question your wheels, wish they was round more\nThe ilk of your found cloth are you built for the downpour\nAll I try to do is lead by example\nSeems some are content with niggas feedin' them a sample\nTried to create a path, know the streets can be a handful\nMe I made it out without degrees on the mantle\nThough my money good, I'm overseas gettin' ample\nIt'll never mean the snakes and all the leeches I can handle\nThe bond is broke now, I believe it's gettin' trampled\nGotta pick up your pants, wear your creases like a man do\n\n[Hook: Eric Bellinger]\nI really don't know where we should go from here\nIt feels like time is escaping\nI don't want to waste it nooooo\nBut in the back of my mind\nIt feels like, like we should just let it go\nWhere do we go?\n\n[Verse 3: Joe Budden]\nIt's been weeks now, maybe we both feel so weak now\nTime's past, should be cool for us to speak now\nAnd you got so much pride, was no surprise\nI had to reach out, shit, you used to creep through my house\nOutside of bein' fine, I always said you was cool\nYou would leave in time to get your son ready for school\nAnd I'll admit, that was admirable\nSuckin' me off every night without you ever losin' sight of what you had to do\nFucked for seven months straight, shit was magical\nYou broke it off over shit that wasn't factual\nHow could I fuck with you?\nWith you actin' so gullible and all, I'm reluctant to move forward\nYou fell in love with me quick, was down to wait for me\nBut that held us down, was like a weight for me\nYou wanted answers\nSaid we can't keep fuckin' without a title, you won't sit back idle\nAnd to me it was intangibles\nReasons I couldn't be the man for you\nPart of why a nigga ran from you\nPart of why I was passive and dismissive\nWhy we had that awkward goodbye and I ain't fix it\nWhy I let your Bimmer pull off and I ain't miss it\nI lied cause the truth was really none of your business\nI felt like the hostings, was a hoe thing\nLate nights, strip clubs, really the whole thing\nBut that's my own baggage in fact\nPlus you slept with other rappers at that\nJust some shit that tamed my own brain, this is after the fact\nIt's my bad, not yours, I know the past is the past\nI'm hopin' all's forgiven, you not stuck in that time\nMaybe we can fuck one last time, I'm playin' with you\nHere's to bein' grown and communicatin' issues\nWe was never together but a nigga stayin' with you\n\n[Hook: Eric Bellinger]\nI really don't know where we should go from here\nIt feels like time is escaping\nI don't want to waste it nooooo\nBut in the back of my mind\nIt feels like we should just let it go\nWhere do we go\n\n[Bridge: Joe Budden]\nWhere do we go from here?\nWhat are we doin'?\nWhere do we come from?\nWhere do we go from here?\nCan I talk my shit again?\nJoey\nWhere do we go from here?\n\nParks let me get one more\n\n[Verse 4: Joe Budden]\nI remember it like it just happened\nScratch that, can't dismember it, it just happened\nFunny how one death'll let these mishaps in\nThat's exactly what's about to occur\nI defer, here's the stinger\nI'm right where I grew up and lost my finger\nHow we let it all linger?\nWhole family in black where you used to reside\nAll here to say our final goodbyes\nThem to you, me to them\nMy thought with every tear that I cried\nWhole mornin' I was mournin' family that had survived\nNow that you are gone, you took with you all of the magic that you performed\nAnd so our issues of a much deeper root is born\nThe weight fell, don't know who it's on\nAnd since our glue is gone, this is how we movin' on\nTruth in song, all quiet like the mute is on\nSpeak to me from Heaven above if I'm doin' this wrong\n\n[Outro: Joe Budden]\nSay somethin'\nJust let a nigga know you hear me\nWhere do we go from here?\nRest in peace\nWhat up?\nWhere do we go\nWhere do we go from here?\nUnderstand me?\nDo anybody hear me?\nJoey\nI love you\nWhere do we go from here?"

On the album that I\u2019m going to go and buy, this song is the end. [\u2026] The body of work, the way that I envisioned it, this is the end. [\u2026] This is where the All Love Lost story comes to an end and it\u2019s just appropriate.\n\nJoe then went in depth about the original plan to get some features on the song, namely Scarface and Beanie Sigel:\n\nBefore we knew that this would be the outro, we wanted Scarface on this record. [\u2026] Yeah we did try for Scarface and Beans. [\u2026] Scarface and myself, we were in communication, but you know, as it turns out, in retrospect, in hindsight, I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t do it. That would\u2019ve cerated a new dilemma for me, I wouldn\u2019t have wanted Scarface\u2019s verse to end my album. [\u2026] And again, he\u2019s one of my favourite rappers as well, and he did say \u201cyo, Joe man, you fucking destroyed that shit man, but we gon get together\u201d, so I told him I would hold him to that."

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Joe Budden]\nJust gotta get these thoughts off real quick\nSee I'm a thinker, it's like thinking shit\nIt's when you got..\nYou sittin' there reflectin', thinkin' shit\nI peep it though\n\n[Verse 1: Joe Budden]\nLook, you liked me better before you knew my history\nBefore you knew who I was\nThat's when reachin' our potential felt likely\nNobody like me\nBesides see if I stop bein' who I am\nI'm straight to it, who I might be\nBut you gotta look inside each song\nThat's where I proved it was really in sight all along\nBear it all so the privacy gone\nGrab the pen, sit down and write these wrongs\nJust how I right these wrongs, but look\nYou liked me better when I spoke usin' censorship\nBefore you knew I was really insensitive\nThat was back when it was you and me\nThen curiosity killed you, you had to Google me\nNow I won't call the headlines a liar\nSome are true and some are false, that's for y'all to decipher\nBut look, on rare occasions some of what they say'll bother me\nI liked it better when the 'Net was still a novelty\n'Cause now people who ain't found themselves\nGet an outlet, yet don't know how they sound themselves\nThey like me better when I'm silent and don't have an opinion\nPretendin' to blend in like I'm a minion\nSay if Joe keep talkin' that shit, he'll get him shot\nBut if rappers can't tie my shoes, how can I not?\nThought I had my city's support, I couldn't believe\nJersey City liked me better when I couldn't leave\nI take it back, that ain't set in stone\nThey more so had weapons drawn 'cause I left alone\nI liked it better when I had nothin' to lose\nThe days when I felt like I had somethin' to prove\nShit, even for me that's unusual\nIf you don't give a fuck then who you gotta prove it to?\nJust the world that I was born in\nYou gotta learn to form wins against the storm wind\nThey like me better when I fuck and never call again\nWithout it, they don't know what type of box I belong up in\nThey like me better without reality television\nGuess they didn't need to witness the hell I was livin'\nIn my shoes, you too would seal a fate\nPoppin' 20 pills a day, somebody gon' feel a way\nLook, uh, and so these hoes just to pass time\nAfter the past time, they don't even pass my mind\nYou liked me better way before you got lied to\nBut that don't really matter when you want me inside you\nYour friends sayin' leave, they don't know that you tried to\nYou can't speak to them, I'm the nigga you cry to\nI liked it better when nobody ever heard of me\n'Fore pop had to get that knee surgery\nGuess that affected his bladder\nSo when Jackie called me nothin' else really mattered\nWas scared, sounded frantic, I ain't want no parts of that\nSaid the ambulance came, might be a heart attack\nWas leavin' work nearly cryin' on the phone\nI'm in rush hour traffic, just seen you dyin' alone\nLook, I just pictured all the places that we never went\nAll the texts that were never sent\nAll the words we never spoke\nTime we never shared, rewind so we can repair\nSuch an inspiration, all the holes that you dug through\nThen you got released, God was watchin' above you\nI'm thinkin' you healin', I don't wanna disrupt you\nSo I'm right back to never tellin' you that I love you\nAnd I don't wanna act that way\nIf I take somethin' for granted, I don't wanna give it back that way\nForreal, that's how shit get lost, let me chill\nI like it better when I'm not talkin' over my thoughts, now listen\n\n[Chorus: Emanny + Joe Budden]\nI've done been down, been down, it's all for you\nHow you feelin' out there?\nAnd I don't wanna get in your way\nHow everybody doin', alright?\nGet you somethin' to drink\nAnd I don't wanna get in your way\nGet you somethin' to smoke, get you somethin' to light up\nWhatever your vice is, we here though\nSaid this love is all for you\nThat shit don't be for everybody, man\nSaid this love is all for you\n\n[Verse 2: Joe Budden]\nNow the singers wanna rap, the rappers wanna sing\nPersonally I liked it better back when rappin' was a thing\n'Cause now if you wanna get the high notes\nWhen that hook come, you gotta hit the high notes\nThe label wanna sell singles\nI'm sellin' a story and that'll just taint the message\nBad marriage, we ain't got the same objective\nStill I'm here cause real niggas in the game respect it\nLook, they like it better when I let 'em live rent free\nI never knew that once it stopped we'd be enemies\nAnd though I come off as heartless, nigga\nIn spite of yourself, got love for you regardless, nigga\nNow listen, I liked you better when you wasn't in the spotlight\nWas too addicted to it, said some shit was not right\nSo when you work so much I couldn't complain\n'Til I learnt she was gateway escapin' from the pain\nThe strippers talk to me like I'm their therapist\nThat scares the good girls away, don't know the hell I get\nWhatever thoughts you contrive, I can't help you with\nBut you've been tossin' it for a year and I derail the shit\nI'm self made, I don't do what I'm told\nThe type that needs free reign, to be out of control\nForreal, 'cause when that's gone I'm lost, let me chill\nI like it better when I'm not talkin' over my thoughts, word\n\n[Chorus: Emanny + Joe Budden]\nI've done been down, been down, it's all for you\nY'all don't understand me\nI don't think they get it though\nAnd I don't wanna get in your way\nDon't know why you don't apply like, our experiences and shit\nAnd I don't wanna get in your way\nTo like, my experiences with other people\nSaid this love is all for you, this love is all for you, ooh\nSaid this love is all for you"

    "plain": "In this song Joe specifically talks about himself as an artist, and talks about himself from his own point of view. He talks about how he sees himself as immortal, in a metaphorical sense.\n\nOn Joe\u2019s podcast he had a discussion about the song with the album\u2019s engineer Parks and frequent collaborator Emanny, who said that this was probably the first complete song they recorded for this project that actually made cut.\nHe also mentioned it being recorded at DJ Premier\u2019s legendary HeadQCourterz studio when it still existed."

He talks about how he sees himself as immortal, in a metaphorical sense.\n\nOn Joe\u2019s podcast he had a discussion about the song with the album\u2019s engineer Parks and frequent collaborator Emanny, who said that this was probably the first complete song they recorded for this project that actually made cut.\nHe also mentioned it being recorded at DJ Premier\u2019s legendary HeadQCourterz studio when it still existed."

What if the passion was gone?\nIf we're truthfully speakin', never saw it lastin' this long\nIf the words didn't rhyme, what would I do for a livin'?\nBut I've been dead for so long, I figure I'm due for some livin'\nThey only see the effects, never pay no mind to the cause\nMy thinking is so complex, simplicity can get lost\nWhat if everybody was real and I wasn't surrounded by frauds?\nThe moral in that is so priceless just cause I know what it costs\nLookin' back, damn near every problem, I had it\nNever got 'em retracted\nI combat it, problematic, every problem of an addict\nBut that's just the way the cards fell\nHeartfelt but can you be cheated if God dealt?\nFuck this shit, only regret that I have is ever bein' regretful\nI mean they all tried to kill me, none of them were successful\nA few I knew for some years, some never met me and tried\nBut you can't kill nothin' that's ready to die\n\n[Hook: Joe Budden & Emanny]\nThey say I live my own way, own way, and that's fine\nI'm just livin' my own way, own way, like I can't die\nThey can't remove my heart, my soul might take it's toll\nThe air I breathe and the ground below\nBut no way, no way, let 'em all try\nThat's how it feels to be immortal\nImmortal\nThat's how it feels to be immortal\nImmortal\nThat's how it feels to be immortal\n\n[Verse 2: Joe Budden]\nAnd now I'm feelin' like Steven when he was up in that hospital\nNigga shot him nine times, they got him thinkin' illogical\nCrippled, feelin' immortal, he cheated death, he unstoppable\nHe just want that revenge, nigga, feel like dying's impossible\nThey want me to regress like I ain't been through the worst\nInstead of me bein' blessed, they want me pinned in that dirt\nIf you knew me in the past you would think my winning's deserved\nThey never noticed my path and all the sins I did first\nBoth my parents did drugs, see they put them syringes to work\nAnd I carry that same exact gene, but I never mention I'm cursed\nThose prescriptions were murder, I blame it all on that nurse\nShe started my relapse way back, I developed a thing for them percs\nFuck this shit, only regret that I have is ever bein' regretful\nThem fuckin' pills tried to kill me, none of them were successful\nI close my hands on my knees, send these words to the sky\nYou can't kill nothin' that's ready to die, fuck this shit\n\n[Hook]\nSay I live my own way, own way, and that's fine\nI'm just livin' my own way, own way, like I can't die\nThey can't remove my heart, my soul might take it's toll\nThe air I breathe and the ground below\nBut no way, no way, let 'em all try\nThat's how it feels to be immortal\nImmortal\nThat's how it feels to be immortal\nImmortal\nThat's how it feels to be immortal\n\n[Verse 3: Joe Budden]\nSee I'm so self destructive, hurt anyone that come near\nDone it my whole career, was always one of her fears\nHurt her so much in the past, I'm supposed to be healin' her\nBut she love me so much, she say that it's only killin' her\nNow she say she can't watch it, pill poppin', it's toxic\nPromised her I would stop it, just go hide when I pop it\nIt's a shame we can never be the same, wasn't prideful\nHow can I tell you I'm nowhere near finished bein' suicidal?\nBaby that wasn't me, just some nigga that smelled like me\nFuck like you stuck by some nigga that felt like me\nYou watched me lose weight, you just waited there helplessly\nYou just offerin' help to me, I just dissed at you selfishly\nWhen you left, I condemned you, really I should commend you\nNot for havin' that in you, but for havin' the strength to\nI make amends to you now, you shouldn't have seen me that high\nI killed you when you wasn't ready to die\n\n[Hook]\nSay I live my own way, own way, and that's fine\nI'm just livin' my own way, own way, like I can't die\nThey can't remove my heart, my soul might take it's toll\nThe air I breathe and the ground below\nBut no way, no way, let 'em all try\nThat's how it feels to be immortal\nImmortal\nThat's how it feels to be immortal\nImmortal\nThat's how it feels to be immortal"

I thought they was kiddin\u2019\nShawty Lo said \u2018Dey Know!\u2019, I really didn\u2019t\nDancin\u2019 became cool again, then came \"Walk It Out\"\nBut I ain\u2019t know what the fuck niggas was talkin\u2019 bout\nUnit kicked Game out, they ain\u2019t give a fuck\nThen we see the same shit happen to Buck\nIt was a few years ago, but I remember the summer\n50 made fans start looking at the numbers\nA&R\u2019s won\u2019t take risks, they won\u2019t sign niggas\nThe word \u2018swag\u2019 came out and started to blind niggas\nRap dudes want reality shows\nAnd my dumbass was thinking that reality sold\nDid it start with the iPod?\nOr when rappers had to pay DJ\u2019s for them to do their job?\nNow all the content is the same, it don\u2019t differ\nEverybody sold some drugs or pulled triggers\nThe more you think about, you gonna just get sicker\nI mean, why the fuck would Nas wanna call his shit \u2018Nigga\u2019? NIGGA!\nWas it when the Wu broke up?\nPac, B.I.G., Pun went to sleep, never woke up\nLupe was doing a tribute and choked up\nSome of these stupid ass fans was like, \u201cSo what?\u201d\nSome them they ain\u2019t educated\nFuck blaming the south, we ain\u2019t segregated\nI mean, it was all good around the Kiss and Beans shit\nTook a left turn around the Kiss and Green shit\nMaybe it all started when Roc-A-Fella parted\nWays, it\u2019s natural to shift toward fame\nI watched every last one of dudes shit on Dame\nKind of got that in common, I can dig that pain\nWhen they gave Jay a desk and suit\nThey finally gave a rapper a chance to come execute\nBut somethin\u2019 told me the suits at the tables was hurtin\u2019\nThey Fired everybody, labels started merging\nFar as sales? The decline is strong\nAs the experts, they\u2019ll say that the climate\u2019s wrong\nI mean, some niggas prime is gone\nI peeped it when niggas started puttin\u2019 fake diamonds on\nYou can tell a dude, \u201cI spit better than you\u201d\nBut then he\u2019ll say, \u201cI\u2019m richer for whatever I do\u201d\nI seen all this coming, I knew what we was in for\nBack when Erick Sermon had jumped out of the window\nWas it when Ma$e retired? He couldn't hack it\nTip could, he just needed some more ratchets\nDJ\u2019s, Producers, the one\u2019s who get us the farthest\nSaid, \u201cFuck rappers!\u201d, and they became the artists\nI gotta talk candid\nDid we start having issues around the same time Jimmy and Cam did?\nOr was it when Chingy thought he ain't need Ludacris?\nHis Next album, found out that that was ludicrous\nPapoose and Clipse both survived\nInking with Jive, then getting jived\nYour man Jae Hood repped that D-Block gang\nThen I seen dude dragging his D-Block chain\nOr did one-hit wonders change it all along?\nThey made labels only want to sign a dude\u2019s song\nAnd you really don\u2019t know shit\nIf you think the fans pick the videos on 106\nI\u2019m just stating the truth\nDid it start when Fox stayed in the news\nMore than she did the booth?\nOr was it when Lil Kim stopped exploiting sex?\nThe fuck is up with DMX?\nI hope dude\u2019s straight\nHave an opinion and they gonna say you hate\nI can\u2019t front, I\u2019m missing the old Clue tapes\nNext thing, the underground sunk further\nThe feds was on Irv so The Inc dropped Murder\nI never blame Fab, Jeezy, Rick Ross\nDid shit get lost when Shyne went up north?\nI\u2019ll never understand the hiphop police\nWhen hiphop is what hiphop needs to police\nThese blatant-ass radio attempts sound so bland\nTwista kept trying to recreate \u2018Slow Jamz\u2019\nThen we send the wrong message with our slang\nBroke niggas blowing they rent to make it rain\nSo you walk in and give a bitch a few $20\u2032s\nShe\u2019ll smerk her face up, looking at you funny\nThis chick told me she only take new money\nMan, I snatched my shit back sooo fast\nOr did it start when rappers said, \u2018Fuck it\u2019\nSacrificed music and started raping they budget\nNothing wrong with dude\u2019s being candy or pop\nSomething was wrong when Joc did the Candy Shop\nWe buying our own records, maybe no one\u2019s to blame\nAre we a business that we can\u2019t afford to maintain?\nSecond week show that boy numbers ain\u2019t high\nI hate to break it to you, numbers always lie\nOr when Ortiz signed to Aftermath\nAnd Now he\u2019s feeling the aftermath\nWas it Fight Klub fucking with them battle raps?\nNot too many of them gettin\u2019 signed after that\nI mean, some can\u2019t stay afloat\nA million Busta albums he\u2019s still not mentioned with the GOATs\nFuck looking for answers, time will tell\nWas it when Def Jam didn\u2019t want to resign L?\nA 15-year old told me Cass was ass\nRather than spazz, all dude could do was laugh\nOr was it when the whole East Coast fell off?\nOr got comfortable, maybe dude\u2019s was too well off\nThe more niggas said they didn\u2019t write down lyrics\nThe more it started to sound like they didn\u2019t\nBut, do whatever you can to keep the lights on\nBut Dumbin\u2019 down just became the new \u201cDYLAN!\u201d\nHonestly, I ain\u2019t know what to think\nA few years ago we had the young kids wearing pink\nI can\u2019t blame the fans for not knowing a damn thing\nWhen We trained them to be this way\nI mean showed \u2018em whatever to sell with no limits\nSince the early 90\u2032s, sold \u2018em a false image\nSo when some shit comes that don\u2019t fit the mold\nIt\u2019s like mole and nigga you won\u2019t even do Gold\nThey watch the videos\nSee you on the corner with a whole bunch of people and think that you hood\nThey turn on the TV\nSee these video bitches and they think niggas girls really look that good\nI mean They get so many free verses when the album drops, the shit\u2019s more like a bonus\nWhy pay for it? Why take onus?\nWith one click of the mouse they could own it\n\nI mean some of them are fooled so easily\nBy whatever we say or we show \u2018em on TV\nBut that was all part of the plan\nOr was it when Eminem made \u2018Stan\u2019?\nI swear some of these fans, they put they whole life on the line\nIt\u2019s like they can\u2019t like more than one rapper at a time\nLess about the product, more about the digits\nIt\u2019s a business, we got less fans and more critics\nMaybe we at a cross\nCanibus made one of the dopest diss records but some still say he lost\nAnd I ain\u2019t believe my ears when niggas tried to tell me\nThat KRS-One had a rap beef with Nelly\nIf rap was alive, we\u2019d be trying to be the best rappers ever\nNot the best rapper alive\nBut you won\u2019t get accepted at all if you ain\u2019t street tough\nOnyx was the hardest \u2019til Sticky got beat up\nNow \u2018I\u2019m A Thug\u2019 is how I gotta behave\nIf I wanna be paid, if I wanna see praise\nYou know something\u2019s wrong when niggas are getting shot\nAnd you gotta sit and wonder if the whole thing\u2019s staged\nIt ain\u2019t REAL no more\nOr did we just expand on our audience, maybe we appeal to more\nOr, do we think ya\u2019ll are just getting dumber?\nWe tried to make gettin\u2019 older getting younger\nDid we lose our hunger? Something\u2019s gotta give\nDid we outgrow ourselves? Is hiphop for kids?\nIf it is, they turn on MTV Cribs\nAnd think, \u201cThat\u2019s where these motherfuckers really live!\u201d\nOr, was it when Lauryn Hill dropped a classic?\nSo did the Fugees, til Wyclef tapped it\nSongs don\u2019t do it no more, the shit\u2019s shocking\nSeen it when \u201cLean Back\u201d had the whole world rocking\nNow it\u2019s \u201cFuck your bars!\u201d if your hook is fly\nSo we look at Crooked I with a crooked eye\nDope ass rappers ain\u2019t seeing no dough\nIf everything\u2019s commercial, where the fuck is the show?\nBut anybody making a dime, see ima wish well\nStill we took a big L losing Big L\nOr was it when YouTube came in the game?\nNow nobody\u2019s from their living room can make a name\nOr when Indies like Koch came and blew up\nNiggas at the majors they literally threw up\nTo some, it ain\u2019t fun no more\nYou know it\u2019s fucked up when DMC don\u2019t talk to Run no more\nTo many egos, like we ain\u2019t one no more\nShit\u2019s predictable, niggas ain't stunned no more\nWe startin\u2019 to see shit we never seen before\nAt one point, we even had the magazines at war\nOR, was it street DVD\u2019s like Smack?\nShowed you just how stupid your favorite rapper would act\nThis shit get lifeless\nWhen MTV made a list of the hottest and ignored the nicest\nChanged the whole steelo\nI mean the averaged fan never heard of Goodie Mob or a Cee Lo\nBut they heard of Gnarls Barkley!\nAnd Dr. Carter still say we got a heartbeat\nI ain\u2019t gonna lie, I was scared to death, straight up\nI started to hear rumors of an Outkast breakup\nI was like, \u201cThat ain\u2019t true, it sounds desperate\u201d\nThen started to see Big Boi and 3K separate\nWe had periods where it was drier than a desert\nAre we all killin\u2019 this shit? Is it a group effort?\nAre we alive and well or barely surviving?\nIs it R&B\u2019s fault? Them niggas is thriving\nThen a lot of people go and blame LimeWire\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s downloadin\u2019 dog, the line\u2019s tired\nDid the fans just get tired of the outcome?\nOne dope single and a bullshit album\nSo they share albums with each other\nWas it Master P with them ugly ass album covers?\nOr when we started appearing in the news?\nTimberland said they didn\u2019t want black niggas wearing they boots\nI mean, I know it got foggy, at least blurry\nWhen the label dude got knocked out by Keith Murray\nOr was it when we became obsessed with the brand names?\nHad the kids trying to buy shit they can\u2019t name\nAnd some think the evidence is ample\nDid it start when Puff took advantage of the sample?\nIs it all watered down with no fire?\nIf you had enough money you can buy a ghostwriter\nOr the Diamond District, with Jacob the Jeweler\nHad to buy his watch to be looked at as cooler\nFucking with them trends\nOur stupid asses wasted a hundred grand on shit that ain\u2019t even in\nLook, is the game now as bad as it\u2019s ever been?\nIt\u2019s not ringtones, just the songs that they represent\nI heard all of \u2018em\nThe sad part I wouldn't recognize most these niggas if I saw \u2018em\nI can\u2019t explain it, I don\u2019t know what to tell ya\nNow goin\u2019 Gold is look at as a failure\nMaybe old heads in charge just weren't able\nDJ\u2019s is spinning now with no turntable\nMaybe the fans are just bored of us\nOr maybe there ain't enough room for all of us\nIt\u2019s like, even a friendship will stop at a point\nMike Jones went platinum off of Slim Thug\u2019s joint\nBut there\u2019s so many ways to get fuckin\u2019 rich\nSupahead caked off by just suckin\u2019 dick\nDid we sell out just to get in demand more?\nDid we go against everything we used to stand for?\nBoth are likely\nThere\u2019s two sides to a coin, who you rollin\u2019 with: Souljah Boy or Ice-T?\nSome niggas wanna sit around and complain about\nI rather analyze, seek how it came about\nIf we could rewind the world\nWe wouldn\u2019t have to watch Flava Flav try to find his girl\nLook, today it\u2019s all about marketing and promo\nI remember VH1 was just for old folks\nBut no ma\u2019am\nIf I ain\u2019t know better, I would think that mix show is now programmed\nWe let the power of the dollar annihilate us\nNow the size of our chain gonna validate us\nIt\u2019s too simple, they can\u2019t think we\u2019re really deep\nI just heard Chris Brown on the A Millie beat\nSeen a video, it\u2019s called Lookin\u2019 Ass Niggas\nGrabbed the remote, tired of lookin\u2019 at niggas\nBut that let a nigga know if we ain\u2019t dead\nThen we just half alive, maybe brain dead\nDid it start when Capone left Nore?\nNah, he went to jail, that\u2019s a whole different story\n\nOr, maybe somethings really wrong with our ears\nObie Trice got dropped, so much for Cheers\nFemale emcees, they don\u2019t ever hit the target\nSomebody said they saw Amil working in a Target\nThe sad part is we already lost Remy\nOr did we go wrong when E-v-e got skinny?\nWhat\u2019s up with Jacki-O, Rah Digga, that I can\u2019t figure\nAnd Trina ain\u2019t been the same since Nan Nigga\nI know it had to do something to his heart beat\nWhen Lady of Rage started doing Steve Harvey\nI know we caught a lil\u2019 trama\nSomewhere between Yo Yo, Boss, and Lil Mama\nLot of females found another way to extort\nMost of our video models have turned escort\nDo anything to see dough\nSo they\u2019ll exchange sex with an artist or director for a lead role\nOr should we get back to basics?\nWhere\u2019s the Rakim\u2019s or the Master Ace\u2019s?\nThe Big Daddy Kane\u2019s, or did we never recover\nFrom Dre not being on the side of Ed Lover\nOr when rap dude started signin\u2019 their friends?\nInstead of going out and tryin\u2019 to find niggas with skill\nSeen it happen when D-12 put out Purple Pills\nAnd while the whole hood laughed, them niggas sold a Mil\u2019\nSome of us ain\u2019t prepared for something so lucrative\nI just heard Yung Berg say some stupid shit\nLike we almost caught one in the torso\nWhen each Bone Thugs member took they own crossroads\nSome disagree, some gotta see the same\nOr maybe Hip Hop died on Aailyah\u2019s plane\nIf it relocated where did it move to?\nI still Love H.E.R. the way Common used to\nOr did Bill O\u2019 Reily come fuck up the spirit?\nWith negative remarks about everybody\u2019s lyrics\nSpend all this time dissin us\nNigga you 95 years old motherfucker shouldn\u2019t be a listener\nLost Jam Master, who was tougher then leather\nOr did it start when Treach started fuckin Pepa?\nAs our jeans got tighter and our tee\u2019s got longer\nI\u2019m trying to figure which age group we belong to\nOr did we all go astray, the second Dr. Dre left N.W.A.?\nI mean in my opinion we was on easy street\nWhen he was beefin\u2019 with Eazy-E\nOr did we get fucked up when producers found a way to cheat?\nSignin unknown niggas to start making their beats\nIf you sell your own shit it gotta go for cheap\nPut my name on it and the price increase\nOr, is it cause everybody\u2019s so self-centered?\nIs that the reason Hip Hop itself ain\u2019t centered?\nOr have we already seen this shit with our own eyes?\nRico Suave, Hammer, and Vanilla Ice\nEverybody want in the game so in return\nYou got label executives fuckin\u2019 their interns\nAnd anybody lookin\u2019 at that new Vibe bracket\nShould see that they don\u2019t know a thing about this rap shit\nOr maybe we shoulda stopped being proud\nWhen there was no more Rawkus and no more Loud\nTried to get conscious around Vote or Die\nSo they made it look like all our votes was lies\nAs the years go on it\u2019s like we keep gettin more voids\nWe got lost when we lost one of the Lost Boys\nI knew we was impersonating a fraud\nWhen Kay-Slay smacked my man at the awards\nRegardless, it\u2019s our fault as artists\nRunnin\u2019 with entourages who act like they ain\u2019t never left the projects\nWho do we wanna target\nWill they put an Uncle Murda cd in a Wal-Mart or a Target\nWe got the nerve to not wanna hear Ras Kass\nBut fuck with V.I.C. \u201cGet Silly\u201d and that trash\nI felt ashamed\nWhen J-Kwon told me he ain\u2019t like Raekwon cause he stole his name\nWas back when everybody in the club got tipsy\nNow every contract gotta be 360\nSo fuck eatin\u2019 better scrape the plate\nNow every beat gotta at least have an 808\nDid the lights get dim when we first heard Mims?\nAnd said \u201cAnother New York rapper on the South tip\u201d\nIs it overcrowded?\nThey keep sayin \u201cIf it\u2019s so fucked up, then do something about it\u201d\nI doubt it, there\u2019s just one thing they don\u2019t understand\nThat job is way bigger then just one man\nOr maybe all of these pleas that it\u2019s deceased\nIs false and it\u2019s right where it needs to be?\nMaybe we built on something that\u2019ll last forever\nSee \u2018Face and Geto Boys just got back together\nMaybe no one can stop us, even other genre\u2019s now jock us\nWe even doing songs with the rockers\nHow is that the feelin\u2019?\nKanye\u2019s amazin\u2019, Wayne just sold a Million\nWe closer to a ceilin\u2019\nHow are we in a coma?\nWhen we the only business you can excel without a diploma\nTechnology changed, made everything simple\nMyspace is now a dude\u2019s bio slash demo\nAside from this rap we generatin\u2019 more money\nWe took it global and penetrated other countries\nSo let\u2019s celebrate, sip some Cris\u2019\nSome more shit we embrace just to end up dissed\nGo and buy the bar out so we can all get bent\nLet\u2019s go and cop a bunch of cars just to still pay rent\nOr here\u2019s another bright idea to entertain\nLet\u2019s go and put our face on the bottom of a chain\nAre some of us just nigga rich, with nigga money\nWhile Jews keep laughin, \u201cLook at these nigga dummies\u201d\nShould Hip Hop be a steppin\u2019 stool\nTill we find another role we can step into?\nSome of us doin\u2019 movies as a matter of fact\nAnd some never stopped to plan life after rap\nI mean, as a whole did we stop movin\u2019 further\nAround the time Snoop Dogg went on trial for murder?\nOr was it Scarface creatin\u2019 these clonies?\n30 years later everybody\u2019s still Tony\nMaybe anybody complaining is deranged\nCan you expect something to grow and not change?\nWe\u2019re socially accepted, deviated our old route\nTo simplify the term we all sold out\nI think I figured out who\u2019s to blame\nStarted out Obama, ended up McCain\nSo we Kurt Cobain\u2019d ourself and we\u2019re defeated\nSo next time they ask \u201cwho killed it\u201d tell em WE DID!!!"

    "plain": "The fourth diss made by Budden, this diss track was released after Drake dissed him on the song No Shopping by French Montana. This was the first time Drake publically acknowledged and dissed Joe, despite Joe dropped several diss tracks prior.\n\nThe feud initally began when Joe criticized Drake on his podcast and his album Views, believing Drake was hopping on trends rather than setting them and making decent music. After the podcast was released, French Montana released a snippet of Drake\u2019s verse on his song \u201cNo Shopping.\u201d Drake is seen saying the words to Budden\u2019s hit single Pump It Up. Feeling suspicious about Drake potentially dissing him, Budden released a series of diss tracks.\n\nUnlike the other diss tracks, this one is shorter."

       "plain": "The fourth diss made by Budden, this diss track was released after Drake dissed him on the song No Shopping by French Montana. This was the first time Drake publically acknowledged and dissed Joe, despite Joe dropped several diss tracks prior.\n\nThe feud initally began when Joe criticized Drake on his podcast and his album Views, believing Drake was hopping on trends rather than setting them and making decent music. After the podcast was released, French Montana released a snippet of Drake\u2019s verse on his song \u201cNo Shopping.\u201d Drake is seen saying the words to Budden\u2019s hit single Pump It Up. Feeling suspicious about Drake potentially dissing him, Budden released a series of diss tracks.\n\nUnlike the other diss tracks, this one is shorter."

How we ain't agreeing?\nSensitive thugs need hugs, just the game we in\nBut if we ain't a team, I know what anger bring\nAngled in any language you want it, mons ain't a ting\nIs this a cry for help, show us the pain you in\nWhat's in your cranium, fuck it let's put the flame to aim\nThen they'll ask why I made him his most famous meme\nI just tell 'em love makes you do the strangest things\nThey play at stadiums, I play at Stadium\nShame, shame in 'em, really what's there to gain for 'em\nI see it weird though, fuck it we here though\nOrder my Bane mask all glass to let the beard show\nAin\u2019t been dark in a while, pardon my style\nI mean, I think I hear my part in your style\nI can attach different acts to different parts of your style\nYeah we let you act as if you had parts in your style, nah\nThat's retarded, it couldn't be any farther out\nBut really ain't shit about it that's hard to doubt\nAin't bothered 'bout it, you fathered your father's style\nWhich makes you a grandfather, a clock I highly doubt\nYou a hybrid, credited with the art of it now\nEvolved with a style and re-dressed it in garments from now\nSo listen, that ain't my argument now\nJust looking back through the years, begging me not to involve it \u2018til now\nSo this a pep talk, shouldn't be no awkwardness now\nSweet as the birds and bees from a father to a child\nLook, I know sometimes you gotta father your child\nLike hit the yard for a while\nBut be back before it\u2019s dark or pow-pow\nRage ritual with startling growl\nManufacturer of Coke, here go bars with a smile\nThe shots coming though, crew been at this bar for a while\nThe gun tucked, the snipe's out, you see us, cardigan down\nAdvance for the singing nigga and the margin is wild\nFloetry, the same as Marsh' and them now\nToo bad the martian is out\nWhat song savin\u2019 him when we in bargin\u2019 in wild?\nSingers lose, better go and check Debarge and 'em now\nWe heating up, you know the fire marshall in doubt\nIron and irony, I ain't spoke to Marshall in a while\nHe said \"Budden get your stuff together\nYou busy ruffling feathers\"\nBound to happen when you target an owl\nNow we not enemies, he just gotta bar up now\nI'm still on energy, let's see if he charged up now\nAnd I'll be sure he's in the secret garden I found\nWith lions, tigers, bears, Tahiry, dolphins, wow\n\n[Outro: Joe Budden + Sample]\nYou wonder why\nBounce\nYou wonder why\nBounce\nYou wonder why\nBounce\nJust because\nCome on\nBounce with me now\nBounce\nYou wonder why\nBounce\nYou wonder why\nBounce with me now\nI just love you man\nIt's all out of love\nYou wonder why\nYou wonder why\nYou wonder why\nJust because, I....\nJust because, I....\nJust because, I....\nJust because, I....\nJust..."

Switch your sixteens\nGet some slim jeans, forget your big dreams, I'll make your wrist gleam\nGet your big cream, hope you're lis'ning\"\nI just had to switch to his team, uh, it was tempting\nThe contract was in blood\nHe said, \"I know you sick of trafficking drugs - sign it\"\n\"Nah, I got this\"\n\n[Chorus: Joe Budden]\nLast night I saw the devil sitting in my room\nAnd we greeted with a smile\nSaid that he'd been there for a while\nLast night I heard the devil talking in my head\nSaid this an emergency\nSaid he had some words for me\nHe said\n\n[Bridge: Novel]\nLast night I heard a voice say I've been getting in my own way\nI think I'm falling off the deep end so I haven't been sleepin'\nLast night I heard a voice in my head\nSaid it's an emergency, said he had some work for me\n\n[Outro]\nI think the weed started fucking with a nigga"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Fabolous]\nYeah, yeah\nThese niggas losing their minds, you find that there's no reward\nThey say they already home, it\u2019s really clear they abroad\nThey sound like they boxed in, it\u2019s not just where they record\nThere\u2019s a cost to be a boss they can\u2019t clearly afford\nSwear to the Lord, there's guns like a audience\nYou put on a show, my .40 clearly applauds\nSitting fifth row, I might appear to be bored\nPlotting on a Kanye, but screaming, \"Where\u2019s my award?\"\nBalling out of control, never won an ESPY\n'Bout to buy a black ghost and name that shit SP\nFlow outta this world, I\u2019m coming for my Moon Man\nYou niggas slide back like that walking on the moon dance\nNo glitter glean, handgun with a beam\nHave some boys follow you, Street Fam, Twitter team\nLike you could fuck with me, oh did it seem?\nDr. King and Def Jam ain't the only ones with a dream\nI\u2019m a grown ass man, this kid a teen\nYou\u2019re a spoof of me like if hip hop did a Scream\nAudi coupe looking good so I went and copped it\nGot that TT popping like a trending topic\nMy ride's matte black, my pride is that jacked\nIt might get ya dog shot, even a cat smacked\nAnyway though, styles don\u2019t apply to me\nJeff Goldblum couldn\u2019t be more fly than me\nShorty say, \"Right after the suck, fuck, poof\"\nYou hit it on the head girl, duck duck goose\nYou shoulda got the message that I chuck up deuce\nBreak 'em off and leave it, you seen my fucked up tooth\nIt\u2019s fuck a bitch, it\u2019s more fish in the aquarium\nI rarely hear no, like when niggas ask you to marry them\nThere\u2019s no lights in the place you buy your jewelry from\nFuneral Fab, I\u2019m just here to bury them\n\n[Verse 2: Joe Budden]\nReporting live from the Beacon, booth tired from the beating\nHad foreplay all day, prepping the beat and the mic for a threesome\nWith my vocal bi-coastal, speeding 'til the ride's totaled\nMr. Wi-Fi, out a franchise go to magic, standby local\u2019s\nWatch the track bust once I show my dick size to the Pro-Tools\nI teach you how to have models screaming, \"Get behind me\"\nE-pills and Maybachs ain't gon' matter if your tip is tiny\nNever mind me, we could get knee deep in the beef\nSeek me with the heat but you\u2019ll need more to keep me on a leash\nHere\u2019s a CC for the peeps that wanna see me in the streets\nInvest in Rockports and be easy on your feet\nGive a few hammers, a few semi\u2019s and a few snubs\nTo a few Crips, couple vampires and true Bloods\nGambling in casinos, have a honey handing me my c-notes\nThe modern day Gambino, I\u2019m careful every step I take\nYou the nigga walk up in a shootout with some pepper spray\nThat\u2019d be the last mistake you ever made\nMe, I chop his head off from a rooftop\nAnd race it downstairs just to see if I can catch his fade\nLike groceries when I\u2019m shooting at fags\nMake sure the bread's separated and put the fruits in a bag\nWithstand the hatred, dudes is fallin off doin all they can to save it\nBut everybody's run stops, ask Brandon Jacobs\nWhat y\u2019all call swag to me is all faggotry\nFours want blast at me, that\u2019d equal more casualties\nAbort the strategy or get attacked with that Duracell\nThey put in your back, now that's assault and battery\nYou can keep the bitching to yourself\nThere\u2019s beams on every burner, these lasers, a petition wouldn\u2019t help\nWhat good is having shooters if they the type that miss?\nWhere I\u2019m from, better be careful where you drive that whip\nNiggas put they life at risk for pies they flip\nIn my town, Ben Affleck wouldn't try that shit\nAnd if he did he\u2019d get turned around, burnt down\nTell the new jacks it\u2019ll be a while 'fore they eligible to earn the crown\n\n[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]\nAcid out the baggie, this is more than dope, flawless flow\nFucking off a sign every horoscope done wore my robes\nStrapping up the corner cold, critical\nUnquestioned, my opponents know\nI shoot like Kapono, watch me own the show\nComatose, toasted, getting money while I roam the coast\nStones and boats, mansion homes and hoes\nI deserve \u2018em both, overdose\nTime to earn my votes, watch me turn the volts\nVoltage through a meter, this electric chair, danger\nYeah, I see ya, now make way 'fore it turn to diarrhea\nHear a microphone will give you 3 of everything I wear yeah\nModels by the pair, swear, bottles, private Lear, steer\nStyle that's outta here, rare, thousands by the chair, square\nSleep with me, you came here, war with me is scary\nGet beat silly trying to lamp here, better bring your fury heat\nI got a drop damp here, niggas try me barely\nNo one breathes, I need an ant's ear, pressure's necessary\nGot my mind on the cheddar, kill my haters together\nBury 'em in abundance and starve their families stomach\u2019s\nPaper come in my thumbage, brand new fifties and hundreds\nOn point, just like the drum is, I\u2019m warning them baby mothers\nGot the hunger of a broke rapper\nKill you while I\u2019m rolling up then smoke after\nCatch you at your show, snatch ya, empty out the dough faster\nBentley off the scene, magnum Mo' splasher, four packer\nSouthside nigga spitting coke at ya!\n\n[Verse 4: Royce da 5\u20199\"]\nNickel! This is for the fronters and the naysayers\nI\u2019m about to scare away the drummers and the bass players\nThey say I\u2019m out of my league on this one, so when I get done\nI want you to cut your fuckin' ears off and Twitpic \u2018em!\nLord, I want you to leave this vicinity\nYou gon' be around here 'bout long as Justin Bieber\u2019s virginity\nThis is Jesus identity, mixed with weed, Hennessy, Kennedy, King\nMixed with a kill or be killed killer regime, illest you seen, switch\nY\u2019all write all that hard shit then you fall right off, it\u2019s horrible\nMy oracle is all I offer, so before I borrow your\n'Won\u2019t be here tomorrow' flow, sorry, I will prob'y\nAdi\u00f3s my body wit' somebody toast, this shit just practice\nSickest rapping Baptist, kill your pastor\nSteal your Chapstick, after that make you kiss a cactus\nThen take your ho, make the ho give the whole clique fellatio\nEveryone, that wasn\u2019t the whole entourage on HBO\nThen after that, I tell her, \"I can\u2019t do much with you, shawty!\nI just found out I could fly to Dubai and hire Buffie the Body!\"\nDon't call us if the bitches ain\u2019t flawless\nIf they are then we can hang like Aretha Franklin bra-less\nThe drunk me can box like a sober you\nThe sober me be more nervous than Waka Flocka in the voting booth\nWe beef like being deep and dumping K\u2019s\nYou beef like Lady Gaga and her stylist\nY\u2019all get together to look good in front of a bunch of gays\nMy feng shui is a pump in the desert\nYou\u2019ll come up shorter than an Asian jumping out of a trunk in the desert\nWhile my wolfpack looks for strippers and cocaine\nNiggas snitching, it\u2019s a shame, we call 'em male tattlers\nFiends touching they noses more than URL battlers\nIt\u2019s hard to spit saliva when you spit fire, so I\u2019ll just\nPour sugar in your gas tank, put a banana in your tailpipe\nAh ha, so the car can fit the driver"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]\nJoey what you said, 24 right\nAight cool, I got you\nI define gutter - every time I rhyme\nI climb up another notch, hip-hop got my spine smothered\nBut I'll be fine brother - my mind hovers\nAbove all you jive suckers wishing, that's word to my mother\nYou throw a shot at me, I'm throwing a shot back\nYours is on a joint, mine's whistling by your top hat\nYeah, I'm cool but you violate and I'll cock back\nOpen the mac's mouth and black out like I do not rap\nI'm sick and tired of niggas lying\nThey fifth is lying in the second drawer next door to some bullshit they iron\nY'all be making up stories the little kids is buyin'\nI do everything my Penn State like a Nittany Lion\nI ain't gotta mention the streets on a song\nTo get in a nigga ass on these beats like a thong - pause\nVeterans co-sign me, the up-and-comers scared\nThe pretty girls go, \"papi, here's my underwear\"\nNever in a hundred years I thought I'd be a rapper\nBut in less than a hundred bars I knew I'd be a factor\nI'm PS4 in HD and the screen is plasma\nYou're Atari 2600 with a weak adapter\nBetween us the gap's so crazy\nI'm Gucci, Louis V; you're Gap, Old Navy\nI get coochie in the V, you attract no ladies\nYou're suburb, I'm gutter where the gats go crazy\n\n[Verse 2: Nino Bless]\nFuck a lecture, ain't tryna be Pun's successor\nThat term's done fucker, what up whatever\nYou birds is food, I'm about to pluck some feathers\nI'm young and clever, plus clutch under pressure, yup\nWho does this better\nWalk around with metal all on me like the front of Shredder\nI lust for cheddar you owe me\nLeave holes in your vest that'll open your chest like a sunken treasure\nI'm somethin' like a phenomenon\nDropping bombs for fun then dine in Hell during Ramadan\nWhatever I'm rhyming on or whoever\nI tear 'em apart; swear on my pops\nNo fear in my heart, shit been through it all\nDone swam with the sharks, snapped fins with my jaws\nI'm all that and a bag of the baddest piff\nOff of a brick of hash mixed with acid hits like sick cracker shit\nGet back, dumb birds I ignore the hype\nClick-clack, Yung Berged if you flossing ice\nDawg, cross me twice, can't afford the price\nIt'll cost you, I'll off your life\nYou soft, I told you I'm raw white when I'm on this mic\nStill mourn at night, don't wanna see mornin' light\nAnd I feel like I'm forced to fight\nWhen the CHiPs are down like Ponch fallin' off his bike\nOf course my metaphors are type awesome, right\nI got 'em in awe, my aura's Jordan like\nWhat's really poppin', who diddy-boppin\nYou wasn't really, now you all Common and really conscious\nI ain't with that silly nonsense, I really pop shit\nMy gun stay cocked like Biggie's optics\nI stay evolving but grown bitter\nOn your grave they're carvin' \"Fucked with the wrong nigga\"\n\n[Verse 3: Crooked I]\nI don't write I kill a pen, leak its blood on the page\nI breathe bars like oxygen locked my lungs in a cage\nInstrumentals get fucked on the stage\nA pedophile unless I dig in the crates and fuck with somethin' my age\nForever vow, to never smile when I'm at peace\nOnly when I'm eating the deceased like quiche\nOnly when my enemy's internal organs are a smorgasbord in a feast\nThe Dahmer with melanin led 'em in the belly of the beast\nYou'll be missin' until fishermen see your corpse\nI'll be in Michigan sticking a chicken in my Michelin\nReady to pigeon pitch again from Switzerland to New York\nI was whipping Bentleys before them pictures up in The Source\nI'm a gorilla behind these bars, on some zoo shit\nShoot you while you're talking on some news camera crew shit\nSicker than flyin' in past tense on some flu shit\nDay-old asshole flow, I drop new shit\nExclusive, you don't want it in fact\nI'll have the doctors operating on the front of your back\nTryna keep your stomach intact\nThe spiritual you, leavin' your body, he don't wanna go back\nThat's when the tunnel go black\nI send your soul to the atmosphere\nFuck outta here and your ringtone rap career\nIt's Crooked I: the face of Eastside Long Beach\nPut your ear to the street so you can hear my heartbeat\n\n[Verse 4: Royce da 5\u20329\u2033]\nNickel, yeah\nI hope niggas know I'll show up to your show\nI'll show up where you go, show up to your do', foes will explode\nShells 'fore they hit the floor, I know niggas know\nI got a open window flow, I air shit out\nIn the D they used to call me Mayor Royce\nNow they call me Clay Davis\nGuess why, \"sheeeeeeeeeeee-it\"\n'Cause when it come to them words you know I wear shit out\nI write rhymes like, white lines on a nose tray\nIce cold Ice Cube flow like O'Shea\nRidin' shotgun with Chris Martin - my DJ\nNot the White boy, but I'm down for the Coldplay\nForever stay violent, better stay silent\nHammers stay humming like strumming the mandolin violin\nSpeaking of, I done played a tune of violence\nMore than my nigga Charles Hamilton played Sonic\nI wrap niggas up, clap niggas up, scrap niggas up\nEither that or we gon' slap niggas up\nDump dirt on you right before I go\nInto my Maino mode if I smell the scent of Yung Berg on ya\nTil it ain't no mo', ain't no dough\nGet into his ass cause I ain't opposed, I'm a livin' anal probe\nI'm a lame-ophobe, matter fact my nigga JumpOff\nCan I keep goin' (why the fuck not)\nWhen I was a teen, I used to pack a three-eighty\nNow I'm spittin sittin' between Shady and Jay\nI pull the jeans down on my bitch and then wave\nCause the pussy Max B wavy when she ain't shave\nI leave the booth smellin' like somebody ain't sprayed\nI would talk about Kimbo but I ain't crazy\nI'm like Marty McFly goin' back in time\nAnd dissin' his momma nigga you can't fade me\n\n[Verse 5: Joe Budden]\nThey say he a bastard for real, then they see the ass on his girl\nSo they wonderin' why's he so mad at the world\nI take it out on tracks, I R.I.P. it\nSo even to the producer it's hard to I.D. it\nBars tremendous, it's in your best interest\nI insist your men just do your best Bush rendish\nEndless, move more than two inches\nMy blood'll boil like I got a big skin cyst\nSo end this or see me ma\u00f1ana\nOr see the speed of a llama, underground prima donna\nThat ain't hard to find, pop a E in a Honda\nWith hands like E. Honda, he a monster\nI love war, it's like my pet peeve kinda\nBut for us to even beef you should be honored\nMy dick gettin' hard, I see vagina - pause\nNah, rewind each line each time\nSpeak mine and meet nine, mano-a-mano\nWhen it rains it pours, grab a teflon poncho\nYou now fuckin' with Mouse, the head honcho\nNigga I could fit your house in my condo\nI walk around like ratchets been legalized\nJust me and the Desert Eagle, and an eagle eye\nClosed casket, now you having a boxed wake\nZipper over your head, dude's callin' you Crotchface\nSo y'all could bump \"Swag Like Us\"\nBut the next time rap's discussed add this as a plus\nDon't nobody hit the pad like us\nAnd would get up in that ass but the fag's might bust\nAnd since poppin' tags is a must (what?)\nI hit the bank all I do is withdraw\nChicks removin' their drawers now, your crew is in awe\nHow you ball, your jewels from a cubicle in the mall\nYou gon' need another processor to process it\nI'll set it, I said it\nSo keep running around hot-headed 'til you get hot leaded\n'Til everything but your torso on you is prosthetic\nDigest it, niggas is pie-thetic\nRap what you can't afford, y'all must got credit\nAll you gotta know is Crooked I, Royce, Bless and Joell\nWith Joe spell, NO L"

(or)\nAm I wrong for wishing I could get my cum back?\nLooking for sun, all I see is the hail\nHow I'm gon' trust? All I see is betrayal\nIt's like they keep trying more and more to subdue me\nAnd only you understand, signed by yours truly"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Joe Budden]\nI said all that I'll say, so I stand with no apologies\nI've popped all that I popped, wasn't too recently that it got to me\nThose of yall that love Joe, gotta admit the shit was a lot to see\nToday I take all of the credit like I did away with modesty\nI lost weight, lost faith, I got caught up in that vacuum\nMy stomach turned and my eyes burned, and I became best friends with the bathroom\nToday it takes all the strength I have inside for me to avoid the rush\nFace pokered over the toilet, all you hear is a royal flush\nWas under the control, though they warned me about addiction\nMine manifested again in the form of a prescription\nAnd it's funny what the effects of that little pill'll do\nFunny shit that keeps you alive can also kill you\nBut it's my life, guess I'm stuck in it\nSometimes I wanna just be normal like them other kids\nThe demon I battle with every night is simply drugs and shit\nBut I'll runaway from it all if God deems that I've had enough of it\n\n[Hook]\nThey say don't get lost, follow the leader\nAnd don't do that, be a believer\nWhen the sun goes down, you better hide\nIt's a dangerous world, better stay inside and\nRun along, run along\nIt's a long long way, home from here\nRun along, run along\nIt's a long long way, home from here, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: Joe Budden]\nUh, it go, look\nHow come they can roll? God tell me how come they can smoke, they can drink?\nThey get to do whatever they want and it don't interrupt the way they think\nThey all get to be regular, why is it only me this odd?\nMe who can't even stand up straight, me who can't even keep a job\nMaybe I'm asking for too much, a tiny piece of normalcy\nOr an answer to any one of my fucking prayers that's asking what's wrong with me\nMaybe I'm tired of being unique, tired of being that outcast\nI'm tired of me being the only one, so tired of you all not knowing about that\nI'm tired of it all, want me to fall a spectacle, for the crowd to see\nOr being the only one with faith, I'm tired of everybody doubting me\nI'm tired of responding to grown ass folks that think so motha fuckin childishly\nAches, wish I could take my parents' genes the fuck up out of me\nTired of wanting to run somewhere, tired of having to bare it all\nTired of you fucks constantly taking from me and I'm willing to share it all\nTired of being objective, I'm tired of having to hear it all\nBut being alone is the only way I know to never be near it all\n\n[Hook]\nThey say don't get lost, follow the leader\nAnd don't do that, be a believer\nWhen the sun goes down, you better hide\nIt's a dangerous world, better stay inside and\nRun along, run along\nIt's a long long way, home from here\nRun along, run along\nIt's a long long way, home from here, yeah"

   "lyrics": "[Prod. by DJ Pain 1]\n\n[Intro]\nSL\nParks on the board\nReal niggas in the booth, let's go\nI got Kdot on the keys\nIt go (it go)\nCheck this, listen\n\n[Verse 1]\nI got strangers in my face\nBeggin' me to take a picture\nStill self-centered, they can give a fuck 'bout how a nigga feel\nBitches hang around to hang around even when shit get real\nBut I ain't left nothin', maybe I should write a different will\nThey usin' me I'm usin' them, they don't see the angle\nTherapeutic, I don't even fuck 'em unless it's painful\nWhy do all these bitches seem to think they can change Joe?\nJudge me all you want I never claim to be an angel\nPatriotic, psychotic, obsessive-compulsive, convulsive, neurotic\nOn narcotics, searchin' for you if you got it\nSeein' young blacks gettin' killed weekly that's a moot fact\nIf these coppers shoot at me, trust me I'mma shoot back\nMaybe y'all 'll pray for me\nBut I don't mean once or even twice, I mean every day for me\nSo I'm on my knees, there's gotta be a better way for me\nOpen these windows and these doors but demons stay with me\nAnd baby that's okay with me\n\n[Hook]\nI gave you my all, what made you wanna leave?\nFuck with my heart and now it's killin' me\nThis be enough to make a nigga cry\nI wish 'em well until this runnin' dry\nThey won't ever take me alive\nAll I ever do is survive\nAnd I know cause they already tried\nIt's too late cause I've already died\nAt least inside, they'll never take me alive\n\n[Verse 2]\nLemme get far as fuck away from these niggas\nFuck away from these hoes\nWhere I'm at now its fuck music I don't wanna rap\nI don't wanna perform or host\nAnd my father's sayin' \"get it together\" and nothin' matters but my health\nHope heaven reserved a section for an addict like myself\nWatchin' myself on TV see my knees shaking on that show\nPlus the way shorty's life is now, I bet she's rethinking that \"no\"\nShe thought she was only sayin' no to marriage\nBut that \"no\" is to so much more, now I can't wait to see what her path is\nI guess being a wife ain't sound as fun as bein' a bad bitch\nCouldn't deal with my habits, wasn't me though you'd been catfish\nWe're speakin' a different language\nShowin' you the signs in morse code\nLast time a nigga loved two bitches I lost 'em both\nSo she scared, try not to get emotionally invested\nI know God will find a way for those emotions to get tested\nWhich is cool, maybe not for me\nFront all you want in your heart somewhere\nI know there's a spot for me\nThe sad part is when it's vacant, I'll be gone\nHow I love you but I hate you\nAnd all you're doing is being the person that I made you\nFrom hateful to graceful\nFrom rageful to grateful\nThen God came and snatched that space for you\nI tried to save it boo\nEverything I caught myself building  to that point was made for two\nWriting out the script, wish you'd a told me the page was full\nBut fuck it, He knows better than I\nRegret'll subside, let's sever the ties\nAfter all it's just one less goodbye\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nLemme get far as fuck away from these bitches\nFuck away from these hoes\nLemme get far as fuck away from my niggas\nLemme get real close to my foes\nThey tellin' me that I gotta act famous now, etcetera\nI been regular, so I feel like an anus now\nSee all of this time I've just been treatin' y'all accordingly\nOn an even plane like no one is any less or more than me\nBut the Lord agrees he said, \"keep playin' with fire, if you're Joseph you'll get burned\"\nI hate second guessing I'll wait 'til the motives get confirmed\n(..)\nCall from the shorty, we off that bitch, option time\nModels, sport some\nAll these cities, I got to tour one\nAll these bottles, I got to pour one\nAll these hoes, i got to call one\nOur situation is a tall one, what you gonna do, pour or run?\nSo I'm spending forty thousand dollars on a time-piece\nHelp my self esteem and get this shit up off my mind please\nAnybody lookin' for me, y'all know where to find me\nI be right up Steinway nigga I ain't playing hide and seek\nLet that liquor induce ya, then watch how fast it go from a couple niggas on the hookah\nTo some triggers, to them shooters, everything that's going on is kinda sicker than I'm used to\nI'm just wrestling with them snakes, you ever kick it with Medusa?\nLet me get the fuck away from these pills\nThe fuck away from this drinkin'\nLet me get the fuck away outta my way\nLet me get far as fuck away from my thinkin'\n'Till it's better, it's whatever, shit I'm unapologetic\nSince all i got is my word nigga tell 'em that i said it\nIt's Joe\n\n[Hook]\n\nUhh, uhh, uhh\nIt go\n\n[Hook]"

Or would his world be shattered?\nAnd if you didn't care would it really matter?\nWait, could say it ain't the ride or the whips\nBut tell him the size of the ship\nOr, just tell him you were tired of his shit\nAnd I reminded you of how live it gets\n\n[Hook 1 & Hook 2]\n\n[Verse 2: Joe Budden]\nTell him you don't feel appreciated\nTell him with me it's alleviated\nIncomparable\nHow I do things that he wouldn't dare to do\nOr act like I ain't affraid to take it there with you\nWait, as a matter a fact\nTell him he could be mad at the fact\nYou finally met a nigga that ain't mad at your past\nOr tell him he can be mad at the past\n\n[Hook 2]\n\n[Bridge]\nYou get his call and he asks what you doing just say, \"With your friends\"\nAnd while you on that phone waiting for him to hang up, girl, I'll be here\nReady to take over\nYour body's yearning for what he can't give\nAnd I know just how y'all's story gon' end\nOnce I give it to you, babe\n\n[Hook 1]\n\n[Hook 3]\nTell him you mourn him, tell him you're on it, tell him you can't see, your life without me\nTell him he's deaded now, all because I'm alive\nTell him it's wetter now and you love it when I'm inside\nTell him you like your hair pulled, tell him you like my tongue there\nTell him in detail, make sure you not unclear cause he gotta know, cause he gotta know\n\n[Hook 1]"
